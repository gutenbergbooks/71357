  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I.<br> <span class='c009'>AMONG THE HILLS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>He had been toiling under the noontide heat
up the narrow defile which led from Grassenfel
to Tordale. He had grown weary of the way, of
the rough path, of the rugged scenery. He had
looked to his right hand and to his left, and
behold on the one side stormy Skillanscar met
his view, whilst on the other the peaks of Helbeck
rose towering to the summer sky.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had looked straightforward, and there were
mountains still—mountains that seemed to hem
him in, and make him a prisoner in their rocky
fastnesses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Toiling onward, he had been thinking how long
was the road; how great the distance; when all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>at once the path bore sharply round the base of
a projecting rock, and brought him suddenly
within view of Tordale Church.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the everlasting hills overshadowing it,
with the murmuring waterfall singing ever and
always beside it; the sweet melody to which so
few came to listen—with the larches and the
pines waving their branches gently over the grassy
mounds in the graveyard, with the August sun
pouring his beams down the mountains on the
dancing rivulet, on the smooth velvety turf, Tordale
Church stood on a little mound commanding
a view of the valley, that broke like a revelation
of beauty on the traveller.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had walked far to see this piece of God’s
handiwork; he had toiled wearily up the defile,
over the rocks, between the mountains, to find
this gem which was set so securely among the
hills, that the eye of stranger rarely rested on
it. He had walked far, and he felt that he was
not so young as formerly; yet when the glorious
view opened before him Captain Henry Gower
Stondon forgot the distance, thought no longer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>of fatigue, but, pausing, drank in the loveliness
he beheld.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was high noon among the Cumberland hills—high
noon on a Sunday in August—and the
mighty Sabbath hush pervaded all Nature,
whether animate or inanimate.</p>

<p class='c011'>Far away down the valley, where the rivulet
trickled on slowly to join the Derwent, where the
grass was greenest, and the sun least scorching,
cows lay lazily chewing the cud—sheep browsed
the sweet herbage leisurely. There was a solemn
stillness amongst the mountains; the sunbeams
rested in great patches where they had first
fallen; the wind, as it came and went, and went
and came, stole through the tree-tops noiselessly;
no bird burst from the ivy or the broom, breaking
with sudden flight the stillness of that noontide
hour; the wild bee was so deep in the foxglove’s
bell, that it had no time to tell of the treasures
lying there. Even the grasshoppers seemed to
have forgotten their song; and but for the church
and the graves, the stranger who now looked on
Tordale for the first time, might almost have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>fancied that he had reached an uninhabited Eden,
never before trodden by the foot of man.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very slowly he ascended the steps leading to
the graveyard—primitive steps they were, too,
Captain Stondon noticed, cut out of the clay,—with
a piece of the stem of a fir-tree, split in two,
placed as a guard on each,—awkward and dangerous
steps for unaccustomed feet to essay; but
it was only well accustomed and willing feet that,
as a rule, mounted them, for Tordale was far from
any town, quite out of the way of tourists, and
the men and the women who paced along the
mountain sides, and up the valley to the church
beside the waterfall, came not for any fashion’s
sake, not to listen to strange words and strange
doctrines, but for love of the old story that
will be ever fresh to each succeeding generation,
as it was to the shepherds who first heard the
glad tidings of great joy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It all comes to this at last,” thought the
stranger, as he sat him down in the church porch,
and looked at the green mounds, at the few mossy
headstones, at the one solitary attempt at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>monument; “it all comes to this. Let us start
where we will, let us go where we may, let us
wander over the world where we like, we must
end here at last; we must come to the inexorable
six feet by three, to the lonesome house prepared
for us before we were born. One might have
thought that death would have passed over such
a valley as this; that sickness could never enter
here; that there were scarcely any people to die
in such a nook, and yet—and yet it is just as full
as its fellows; the graves are beginning to jostle
one another, and new headstones are fighting for
precedence with old. It is the same wherever
I go; the road always ends in a churchyard, the
inhabitants are always to be found here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And with a not unpleasing feeling of melancholy,
the man who thought this, let his eyes
wander out, out, over the landscape on which the
sleepers around could never look more.</p>

<p class='c011'>What did the thought signify to him; what
did death mean to this man who had faced it so
often that it had no terrors left? What was the
meaning of the reflection that passed through his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>mind as he sat in the church porch, looking down
upon Tordale Valley? Simply this, that though he
knew in an abstract kind of way he must die,
yet that the wandering life he had led, had made
the idea of when, and how, and where he should
meet his fate so very vague and shadowy, that
he never brought the subject really home to himself,
never realised that six feet by three would
some day suffice him as surely as it now sufficed
others who had wandered, perhaps, as far as he.
After looking on all manner of cemeteries; after
seeing his comrades lying down to rest in India;
after visiting the sepulchres in the East; after
criticising Père-la-Chaise; after passing the London
pest-grounds; after treading over pavements
beneath which generations slumbered peacefully;
after entering country churchyards where, after
life’s fitful fever—after its mad delirium, after its
success, its disappointments, its joys, its sorrows,
its wild hopes, its unutterable agony—men and
women slept that sleep, of the mysteries whereof
we know so little, but which we may humbly
hope is dreamless—he had come to think of death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>as a thing outside himself, as a fact which concerned
others more than it did him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rude forefathers of this hamlet knew where
their mortal remains would be laid. It was a
hundred to one against their bodies being carried
out of the valley—even so far as Grassenfel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Most probably, as they came Sunday after Sunday
to service, their eyes rested on the spot
where, when they had held the plough for the
last time, when they had turned their last furrow,
scattered their last seed—reaped their last harvest—sold
their last crops—they would be carried,
as their fathers before them had been carried, and
laid down far away in the earth, beyond the cold
of the winter snows, beyond the heat of the summer
sun, out of the sight of the young spring
flowers—where the moaning of the autumn winds
and the rustle of the autumn leaves might never
disturb their repose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How close all this must bring death,” thought
the traveller. “What a certainty they must feel
about it—what a strange feeling such people
must have on the subject.” And Captain Henry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Gower Stondon grew so interested in the idea
that he leaned his chin on his hand preparatory
to thinking out the matter with greater comfort.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must bring it very near. I do not know
that I should like it;” and then he went on
to reflect further that it must be unpleasant also
to have the whole of life bounded by those hills,
by those frowning mountains; to have to play
out the whole drama of existence in that green
sequestered valley; to have the horizon of external
experience brought so near that an hour’s
walk at any time would enable a man to lay his
hand upon it; to have his internal hopes, wishes,
fears, joys, bound up in a few acres of land, in
a score or so of acquaintances; to have Grassenfel
for his longest excursion; to see those eternal
peaks for ever lifting their heads to the sky; to
come Sunday after Sunday through the valley,
up the steps, across the threshold, and so into the
little church, in the porch of which he was then
sitting; to be christened there; to be married
there; to be buried in some nook of the graveyard
that sloped so sunnily towards the south! Captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Stondon, who had been a wanderer on the face of
the earth from his youth up, decided that he
should not like such a lot at all; and that such a
lot—the sole birthright of millions—was a curious
one to sit in the shade and strive to realise.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the porch he could get a side view into
the church; he could see some of the people about
whom he was speculating—a fine stalwart race
of men and women—a generation of handsome
giants, with faces hard and steady and impassive,
and enduring as the mountains under whose
shadow they dwelt. A people who had something
of the Scotch blood in them, who were not a fickle
and light-minded generation, but rather occasionally
be a trifle obstinate and stiffnecked.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their very psalms were not as the spiritual
songs of the dwellers in cities, of the inhabitants
of the plains. There was a fierceness about the
old Cameronian hymn they were singing which
seemed in keeping with the loneliness, the desolation,
the unutterable grandeur and solitude of the
spot wherein this isolated band praised the Lord.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no organ—a violin and a flute sufficed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>to guide the choir; and with all their hearts,
and with all their souls, the congregation aided
the vocalists. The singing might be a little loud,
perhaps, but it was not discordant; and suddenly,
at the third verse, as though she had been holding
back till the others got so thoroughly into the air
as to overlook her, some girl lifted up her young,
clear voice; and while Captain Stondon almost
involuntarily rose to listen, mourned out,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Our night is dreary, and dim is our day,</div>
      <div class='line'>And if Thou shalt turn Thy face away,</div>
      <div class='line'>We are sinful, feeble, and helpless dust,</div>
      <div class='line'>With none to look to, and none to trust.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“What a voice!—good Heavens, what a voice!”
thought the officer; and he drew more to the
inner door to see if he could discover the singer.</p>

<p class='c011'>A chord or two from the violin, and the hymn
proceeded,—</p>

      <div class='line'>“The powers of darkness are all abroad,</div>
      <div class='line'>They know no Saviour, they fear no God;</div>
      <div class='line'>And we are trembling in dumb dismay—</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, turn not Thou Thy face away!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>He had entered the church by this time, and
found her. She was but three seats from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>porch. He could have stretched out his arm and
touched her; but the sexton, honest old man,
just as though he divined the stranger’s wishes,
opened the door of the pew she alone occupied,
and signed to Captain Stondon to enter, which
signal Captain Stondon, nothing loth, obeyed
accordingly, and with his face bent over his hat,
hearkened to the last verse,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thine aid, O mighty One, we crave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not shortened is Thine arm to save;</div>
      <div class='line'>Let not Thine anger ever burn—</div>
      <div class='line'>Return, O Lord of Hosts, return!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Then the officer, who, though he might be as
polite as most people, was not above feeling
human curiosity, turned and looked at the girl,
who owned a voice which seemed to him more
like the warbling of a bird than anything he had
ever heard before in his life,—turned and looked
at Phemie Keller, at a girl dressed in a pink
muslin gown, which had evidently been bought
and made for some middle-aged woman, which
had been as evidently worn shabby by the older
individual, and cut down and altered for its present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>wearer—a divinity in a washed-out, large-patterned
curiously befrilled dress, a Hebe in a
cottage bonnet trimmed with brown and white
checked ribbons—a beauty who wore thread
gloves, and had on a rusty-black silk cape that
might have belonged to Noah’s grandmother.</p>

<p class='c011'>But her face! Such perfection of colour—such
delicacy of feature! Where had this rustic stolen
her beauty? Eyes of the deepest, softest, darkest
blue; eyes that looked black when you looked at
them in the shade; dark brows and lashes; and
hair—without half a dozen paints to my hand to
mix together, and blend, and powder with gold
dust, I could never hope to show what Phemie’s
hair was like; and I could not then, because, as
she moved, the shade changed also. Now it was
sunny, now brown, now red, now brown and sunny,
now red and brown; and then red, and gold, and
brown, would all mix and shimmer together in
the varying light.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hair to have made one of the old Venetian
painters go mad, first with rapture and then with
anger, because brush and palette could never hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>to reproduce its colouring—hair that might well
(to recall the quaint conceit of other days) tangle
a lover in its meshes;—hair such as Captain
Stondon had never seen before, though he had
mixed much with society, and been favoured with
locks, not a few, in the days when he was young,
in the days that were gone and fled.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the matter of beauty, the officer had, his
whole life long, been possessed of a truly catholic
taste. Before loveliness he had always, figuratively
speaking, bared his head, and bowed down
and worshipped. Dark locks and shining curls,
sorrowful eyes, dimpled cheeks, laughing girls,
thoughtful women, tall and stately, short and
fairylike, Captain Stondon had admired them all.
Given a woman, and pretty, and he would kneel
at any shrine. He would pay compliments, he
would flatter, he would lay all good gifts at the
feet of his divinity save love, and that in the years
departed he had given once to one woman, and
could offer no more, as he firmly believed, to any
living being.</p>

<p class='c011'>That one woman had won his heart, worn it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>played with it, exhibited it, and then, weary of the
toy, had flung it under foot, and trampled it in
her wicked selfishness, in her unfeeling triumph.</p>

<p class='c011'>She sold herself for money, for the pomps and
vanities of a world which courted her exceedingly,
and went and stayed at her house, and followed
her to the grave, and then strove, not without
success, to console her husband for her loss. She
had deserted the poor man for the rich; but
though she had used the former despitefully,
though she had made him work hard for her sake,
though she had left his early manhood and middle
age lonely, he had been true to the love of his
youth, and loved no woman since.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had admired, he had followed in the train
of many a queen of beauty, he had whispered soft
nothings, he had flirted, perhaps, but he had not
loved, he had not married. Matchmakers had
given him up in despair; manœuvring mammas
valued Captain Stondon’s opinion of their daughters,
simply because it was the opinion of a connoisseur,
not because it was that of a person who
might be expected to take any shares in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>matrimonial market. He knew what was what,
in a word, and he consequently knew that the
young girl with the divine voice would grow up
into a most beautiful woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well dressed,” thought the officer, critically
examining her, while the clergyman adjusted his
spectacles, and opened his sermon-case, and
coughed, and looked for his pocket-handkerchief,—“well
dressed, well instructed, with a clever
chaperone, what a sensation she would make
in a West End drawing-room! What a pity that
she should have been born to wear her grandmother’s
old gowns in a place like this, for——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For the wages of sin is death,” was the text
that terminated both his scrutiny and his soliloquy;
and if Captain Stondon had thought for a
moment that the young lady might be conscious
at once of her own beauty and of his admiration,
he was immediately undeceived by her handing
him her open Bible, his attention being called to
the passage in question by the finger of Miss
Keller’s well-worn glove.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a shock; it tried the officer’s gravity for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>the moment; but his companion so evidently
regarded him as a very common-place stranger,
to whom she was nevertheless bound to offer the
customary civility of the neighbourhood, that it
would have been difficult for him to help feeling
his vanity touched also.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nevertheless, he took the book, and he looked
at the text, and he listened to the sermon, not a
bad one by the way, with the attention expected
from him; and, when the service was over, he
walked out into the graveyard, where, taking
possession of a quiet corner, he watched the congregation
returning, some down the valley, some
under the shadow of the mountains, some up the
hill paths, to their respective homes.</p>

<p class='c011'>If there were one figure the officer’s eyes followed
longest, it was that of the girl beside whom
he sat in church. She had waited for a man
whom Captain Stondon recognised as the violinist
of the choir, and he now looked after the pair as
they climbed the side of Helbeck, and wended
their way—whither?</p>

<p class='c011'>Listening to the low murmur of the waterfall—looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>idly now down the valley, now up to the
summit of the distant hills—Captain Stondon
stood with his arms resting on the churchyard
wall, cogitating whether he should return to Grassenfel,
or inquire for some place near at hand in
which to rest and refresh himself, when he was
roused from his reverie by the clergyman, who,
passing through the graveyard, saw the stranger,
and spoke to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The place was so lonely—so few tourists penetrated
to Tordale—that it seemed natural to the
clergyman to accost the middle-aged individual
who had listened with much apparent attention
to his sermon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Where people are few acquaintanceship is easy.
Perhaps also the clergyman saw something in the
bearing of the stranger which had been overlooked
by Miss Keller; in any case, he paused to speak,
and then the two men walked down the steps
side by side, and, turning from the direct path,
strolled towards the waterfall together.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a picturesque spot: over the rock came
the mountain stream, dropping with a dull, monotonous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>splash into the basin it had worn for itself
below, whence over moss-grown stones it trickled
off into the valley beyond. A few trees overshadowed
the pool beside which Captain Stondon
and his companion stood for a moment in silence
looking at the Fall; ivy and lichens covered the
face of the rocks, ferns and foxgloves grew
between the stones, and the water bathed the
green banks, and touched the familiar flowers,
and mosses, and blades of grass caressingly, ere it
left them behind for ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were broom and gorse, and patches of
heather on the hill-side; underfoot, the turf was
smooth as velvet; above their heads was the
clear blue sky; around was loneliness and nature;
and, as if reluctant to break the spell, the two
men held their peace, until Captain Stondon,
stepping from stone to stone in order to reach the
basin, declared he must have a draught of the
water, it looked so cool, and pure, and sparkling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“While you drink you should wish,” remarked
the clergyman, with a smile; “and if it be, as I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>suppose, your first draught, your desire will surely
be gratified.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wish!” repeated the other, seating himself
on a fragment of rock. “It is an important
moment. What shall I wish?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must not tell me, or wishing will be useless,”
was the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What have I to wish for?” persisted the
officer; “what is there left that I could wish to
come to pass, unless for the years of my youth to
be given back to me? and I could scarcely wish
for that. Mine has been a happy lot as lots go;
still, I do not know that I should like to travel
the road over again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you wish nothing for your wife?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have none. I have neither wife nor child,
sister nor brother, nephew nor niece,” and as he
said this a change came over his face, and,
stooping towards the pool, he took a long, deep
draught, as he did so silently wishing this wish,
or rather praying this prayer, “O God, when Thy
good time comes, leave me not to die alone!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he stepped back on to the green turf, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the pair fell into conversation about the place and
its scenery, about the parish and its inhabitants,
about the church, and how long it had been built,
about Cumberland generally, and finally about the
world that, full of temptation and struggle and
pleasure and disappointment, lay outside those
mountains, far away from the green valley of
Tordale.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='c009'>TORDALE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>It was so seldom that the Vicar of Tordale met
with any man able and willing to talk about the
outside world in which he had once played his
part, that he felt loth to lose his new acquaintance,
and insisted on Captain Stondon accompanying
him home, and accepting of such hospitality as
a widower’s <i><span lang="fr">ménage</span></i> could afford.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finding the prospect of rest and refreshment
by no means disagreeable, the officer availed himself
of the invitation, and before the afternoon
was ended, very friendly relations were established
between himself and his host.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both were lonely men; but there all similarity
between themselves or their antecedents stopped.
The one had lost; the other had never possessed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>The one had hoped much, and yet the low-ceiled
parlour of a country vicarage, which a stranger
rarely entered, to which there came few new
books, no excitement, no change, sufficed him
now; the other had started in life with his way
to make, with no apparent future save what his
own right arm should win for him, and yet at
forty-five he came back from India to enter into
possession of Marshland Manor and four thousand
a year.</p>

<p class='c011'>The vicar had married young, and been the
father of many children; the officer had never
married, and at fifty-six had no nearer relative
than Montague Stondon, barrister-at-law, who was
some fifteenth cousin of the owner of Marshlands,
and next heir to that desirable property and the
rents appertaining thereto.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Stondon had done his best for his relative;
he had invited him to Marshlands; he sent
him up presents of game and fruit and—money;
he paid for the education of Montague Stondon’s
only son; and the thanks he got for all his kindness
was a morning and evening aspiration which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>the barrister never failed to utter for his speedy
translation to a better world.</p>

<p class='c011'>Montague Stondon would have driven his relative
into matrimony years before, had it not been
for that little romantic corner of his heart,
wherein he had placed his young ideal of what
marriage should be—an ideal from which the
world and its ways had never estranged him; and
so it was quite a settled matter with everybody
who knew anything about the property that
Captain Stondon would never have chick nor
child, and that if Montague Stondon outlived his
cousin, he might confidently expect to enter into
possession of the Norfolk estates, which were, by
the way, strictly entailed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Without domestic ties, without household treasures,
it was natural that Captain Stondon should
reside but little in Norfolk—that he should
remain indeed only for a very short period in any
place.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the ten years that had elapsed since his
return from India he had visited many countries,
seen many and many a foreign town. His passports
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>would have bound up into quite a bulky
volume; and whenever he started on a fresh pilgrimage,
Montague Stondon offered up his little
litany for him to be brought back to England a
corpse.</p>

<p class='c011'>It might be excusable, and very probably was
excessively natural; but still nobody could say
it was pleasant for a man to know, as Captain
Stondon knew perfectly well, that his cousin,
limping with bleeding feet along the flinty road to
ruin, was cursing him for wearing good shoes and
declining to take them off for his benefit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wherever he went, Captain Stondon felt that
he had his cousin’s best wishes for some misadventure
to befall him; and as he sat opposite to
the clergyman, and listened to his tale of how
this boy had been drowned, of how that one had
studied too hard to pass his examination, and died
three weeks afterwards of brain-fever; of how his
only daughter had married happily, only to be
laid a twelvemonth afterwards in her coffin with
her baby on her breast—he thought that after all
it might be better to have these memories than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>none at all—to have loved and lost, rather than
never to have had anything on earth to take
home and love and entreat the Lord to spare.</p>

<p class='c011'>For these children were with the vicar still;
their memories were green in his heart, and would
remain there till he went to join them; and it
seemed preferable to endure much misery rather
than know no happiness; to bear partings on
earth, to the end that some friends might be
waiting to greet the wayfarer when he reached
the eternal shores.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the vicar his children were not dead—they
slept; they were not lost—merely gone before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He had one boy in India,” he said; and
Captain Stondon at once inquired in what
part.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Benares—he is buried there,” explained the
clergyman, and he covered his face with his hands
for a moment, before he went on to tell how his
son had gone out to India full of youth, and hope,
and life—to die.</p>

<p class='c011'>By degrees, when he had exhausted the tale of
his troubles, Mr. Conbyr grew quite cheerful, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>talked at large of his parishioners, their peculiarities,
their prejudices, their attachments. Like
all clergymen, he had his little budget of petty
annoyances to open and explain—how there was a
strong element of Dissent in Tordale; how Methodists
from Grassenfel held house-to-house meetings;
how the service was not conducted exactly
to his liking; how he wanted a new collection of
psalms, and his congregation would have none of
it; how the choir was poor, and required an organ
to back it; how sorely Tordale stood in need of a
squire and squire’s family to take a high hand in
the parish; and how, in fact, Tordale required but
being altered in every particular to become a
model valley—a valley for all England to hear of
and envy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he retraced his steps, and praised his
people, their sturdy independence, their rough-and-ready
kindness, their thorough devotion, their
willingness to help one another; and how long he
would have gone on lauding their virtues it is
impossible to say, had Captain Stondon, seizing
his opportunity, not inquired,—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“Pray what is the name of that young person
who was in the same pew with me to-day—a girl
with auburn hair, and a magnificent voice?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! you remarked her voice, did you? That
is the cousin, or niece, or niece by marriage, or
something, of the very singular individual who
plays the violin in church. She is called Phemie
Keller—sings sweetly, I consider, and is pretty,
too. Do you not think so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sings sweetly! What can the man be made
of,” thought Captain Stondon, “to use such an
expression about the matter? Sings sweetly!
If the nightingale came outside his bedroom
window and trilled to him all the night long, he
would get up in the morning and say he had
heard a nice bird whistling. Pretty, too!”
Straightway the officer fell to wondering what
manner of woman the deceased Mrs. Conbyr had
been—whether she had black hair as coarse as a
horse’s mane, and a Roman nose, high cheekbones,
and hard eyes; or whether she was a
washed-out looking creature, with the pink
of her face running into the white, and sandy-coloured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>corkscrew curls, and an anxious, frightened
expression of countenance.</p>

<p class='c011'>He thought a person who called Miss Keller
only pretty must have very benighted ideas on
the subject of beauty; and yet the fact was, Mr.
Conbyr had married quite a belle, a sparkling
brunette, whose friends all thought she threw herself
away when she accepted a curate with only a
prospective living for his fortune.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Conbyr had been a toast, a flirt, a very
captivating, winning little creature, and perhaps
it was no wonder that now she was dead, her
husband held to her memory as to his beau-ideal
of all which was most lovely and charming in
woman. Nevertheless even he admitted that Miss
Keller was pretty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And intelligent, too,” he added; “if she
wouldn’t giggle so much, and hadn’t such stuck-up
ideas, and would dress herself more like a
farmer’s niece, she might grow into a superior
woman. But vanity is the besetting sin of the
whole household. Aggland himself tells you candidly
he considers he understands the violin better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>than any man in the country, and he calls his
brother farmers, openly, fools and prejudiced
donkeys. As for me, he thinks me perfectly
ignorant of theology. He has a curious smattering
of learning; can talk French a little, German
a little, and quote some Latin passages. He
draws likewise, and formerly used to play on the
guitar. He has begun to build himself an organ,
which he offered to present to the church when
completed, if I would give him the sole management
of the choir. He had laid himself out to
have none but the members of his own family in
it, and depended on Phemie to lead; but she
refused, and saved me the trouble and annoyance
of declining. ‘Ah, there is the cloven foot peeping
out,’ he said, as if delivering an oration; ‘the
taint of aristocracy, which hates to do anything for
the democracy, appearing.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what the deuce did he mean?” asked
Captain Stondon, bewildered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, he meant, I suppose, that she didn’t
care to sing, and that there was good blood in her
veins. I fancy she is illegitimate. He is always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>raving against the better classes—quite a character,
I assure you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do your mountains grow many such?” asked
his guest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is not a home product,” was the reply.
“Erratic genius of that description is not indigenous
to the Cumberland soil. He is from Hereford,
and his present wife is Lancashire, and his
niece Scotch. His first wife was Scotch also, I
fancy, and he has a tribe of young Agglands,
sturdy, independent children of the hills. It is a
strange household altogether, and one that, could
I persuade you to stay with me, I should take you
to see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” said Captain Stondon; “but I must
leave Cumberland to-morrow. I am going first to
Norfolk, and then abroad. I shall always think
pleasantly,” he added, after a pause, “of the valley
of Tordale; always retain a memory of the happy
Sunday afternoon I have spent with you.” And
with that, as it was now getting on towards the
hour for evening service, and as he had far to
walk before he could reach Grassenfel and his inn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>together, the officer rose to go, but his intention
was overruled by his host.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will not ask you,” he said, “to come to
church, because, if you must return to Grassenfel
to-night, it would throw you too late on the
road; but walk back with me to the waterfall,
and then I will show you a path which runs right
along the side of Helbeck for a couple of miles
at least. You can form no idea of the beauty
and grandeur of the defile till you have seen it
from above, and the path, an easy one, leads down
to the road you came by before you reach the
Broken Stone bridge. The view from the top is
worth seeing. I only wish this was Monday instead
of Sunday, so that I could go with you
myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Having made which frank confession the clergyman
took<a id='t31'></a> out his sermon, put on his hat, took
his stick, and announced his readiness to depart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can accompany you a little way up the
path,” he said; and accordingly the pair sallied
out again together, and sauntered through the
green vale side by side.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>If Tordale had looked lovely in the noon time,
it was more beautiful still in the soft evening
light. It wanted then nearly an hour to sunset,
but the western sky was already like molten
gold. Down the hill-sides long shadows were
lying; still, sad, and stern looked the mountain
peaks, with each jagged projection—each sharp
outline—clearly reflected against the evening
sky. A cloud frowned over Helbeck, which betokened
a storm, the clergyman thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But it is scarcely warm enough for thunder,”
he added; “and unless the wind dies away we
shall not have any rain before morning. Is not
our valley lovely, Captain Stondon? When you
are abroad—when you are looking at what is
considered far more magnificent scenery,—will
you ever think, I wonder, of our little nook hidden
away among the Cumberland hills?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall never forget Tordale,” answered the
officer, truthfully enough; but little knowing how
truthfully, for all that.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the after days of joy and of sorrow which
he was then walking on, to pass through to reach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the end, he forgot the name of many a town—he
forgot the road by which he had travelled to
many a city; mountain passes, smiling lakes, the
weariness of Indian marches, gorgeous Eastern
palaces, the brilliancy of Eastern flowers—these
things were forgotten, or remembered only as a
man remembers dreams. The Hindoo standing
by his sacred river, the Arabs in the desert, the
long line of foam that alone broke the eternity
of waters as the outward-bound ship cleft her
way to the Cape, the tramp of the sailors as they
paced the deck, the faces of his old comrades
faded, as the years stole on out of sight and out
of mind; but clear and distinct, like the memory
of his mother’s face—like the recollection of his
boyhood’s home—Tordale stood out a picture hung
on the walls of his heart for ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was never to forget it—never to forget the
glory of its noontide, the murmur of its waterfall,
the calm of its lonely graveyard, the ivy, the
ferns, the foxglove and the broom. In the loneliness
and solitude of night he was to feel the
calm of that scene soothe his spirit once again.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>He had but to close his eyes, and he could hear
the dull plash of the waterfall, the rustling of the
leaves, the mourning farewell of the rivulet. He
could look at the long wet blades of grass bending
ever and always into the water, and turning down
the stream as though wanting to be pulled from
their roots, that they might float away and away
with the brook, first to the river and then to the
sea. He could hear the water trickling among
the stones; he could touch the moss with his
powerless fingers; he could feel the cool drops
touching his parched lips; he could remember
how he had drained a deep draught from the basin
in the rock; and then he would think likewise,
if he hasted not to exorcise the evil thought, of
his unavailing petition, of the prayer which had
been granted to the letter, not in the spirit, to
add to his troubles rather than to increase his
joy.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='c009'>IN DANGER.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>After parting from his new friend, Captain
Stondon ascended the path that led past the
waterfall, across the little mountain stream, and
half way to the top of Helbeck. It was hard
work climbing up the track which wound now
through rocks, now over stones, till skirting the
side of the mountain it bore off straight towards
Grassenfel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Heather, purple and glowing, bordered the
track—wild flowers grew beside it. The whole
earth was tinted with the hues of August.
The richest, the most luxuriant month of all the
year was sweeping, like a king in his glory, over
the hills and the valleys, decking the former in
their robes of state, clothing the latter with the
yellow of the ripening corn and the emerald of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the aftermath. To the right lay Tordale, bathed
in the beams of the setting sun; below him lay
the defile that led to Grassenfel; and, like a
speck, he could discern the Broken Bridge which
he must cross on his way back to his inn. Every
crag and peak of Skillanscar shone in the bright
rays of the glory wherein the whole landscape
was steeped; and Captain Stondon, who had sat
himself down amongst the heather to watch to
its close this sunset amid the mountains, acknowledged
to his heart that he had never seen anything
in the way of scenery which so thoroughly
satisfied and filled his soul as the smiling valley
and the desolate hills—the gloomy ravine and the
grey rugged mountains, on all of which the sun
poured his light as though he were blessing the
green earth ere leaving her to darkness and
repose.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last, with more than his accustomed pomp
of red and gold and purple, he set behind the
hills; and, as he did so, the cloud Mr. Conbyr
had noticed, rolled up from the east, covering
Helbeck with a dark curtain of gloom. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>very grand to see Skillanscar reflecting back the
glory of the western sky, but it was by no means
agreeable to Captain Stondon to perceive a storm
brewing so near him. He knew he had lingered
too long on the road already; for which reason
he quickened his pace, and hurried to reach the
point where the path began to descend into the
ravine below. If he could but get to the Broken
Stone bridge before the rain began, he thought
he should be better able to work his way to
Grassenfel.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not easy, however, to walk fast along
the narrow track he was following, and when he
at length commenced to descend, a flash of lightning
heralded the approach of the coming storm.
If his life had depended on it, Captain Stondon
could not have helped halting to listen for the
first peal of the thunder. After a pause it came,
breaking the silence at first with a sullen roar
like that of a distant cannonade; but with every
flash it drew nearer and nearer, echoing from
mountain to mountain, from summit to summit,
till one might almost have thought that height
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>was defying height, and firing volley after volley
across the defile.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the sun the wind had sunk to rest likewise,
and as he stood watching the lightning
darting down the hill-sides, running along the
rocks, and leaping from crag to crag like a living
foe, Captain Stondon became conscious that the
air had suddenly become warm and oppressive,
and that a heat like that of a furnace seemed to
pervade the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What an idiot I was to come this way at all,”
he thought; “what a still greater idiot to loiter
as I have done.” And with the lightning racing
past him, with the thunder crashing and roaring
overhead, the officer turned his face steadily
towards the defile and pursued his road downwards.</p>

<p class='c011'>But spite of all his haste he got on but slowly.
In places the descent was steep and the path
slippery; wherever grass grew, or wherever rock
and stone mixed with the earth, it was difficult to
get a firm footing. What with the evening shadows
which were beginning to fall, and the darkness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>of the cloud overhead, and the dazzling
flashes of the lightning that made everything
seem darker afterwards for their sudden brilliancy,
he soon found he was feeling his way rather than
seeing it—groping down the path rather than
pacing it securely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I could but reach the road in the ravine,”
he muttered, as he slipped and staggered and
recovered himself, and then slipped again. “If I
were only safe at the bottom I might——”</p>

<p class='c011'>He never completed that mental sentence, for
at the instant he stumbled over a loose stone and
rolled down the path, clutching as he went
at the short grass, at the heather, at the
brambles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fighting for dear life, he caught sticks and
stones; he tried to save himself by grasping the
very earth itself; he saw as he went over and
over, the mountain peaks, the ravine, the road he
had been trying to reach, the track by which he
had descended. He could see at that moment as
he could not have seen had he been standing
erect, with the noontide sun shining upon him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Even in his struggle he found time to wonder
what would stop him—whether he should be
dashed to pieces? Among the mountain peaks—a
hundred miles above him as it seemed—the
thunder was pealing. He heard it as he had
heard the roaring of cannon on battle-fields far
away. The lightning came flashing down among
the rocks, and he found time to remember it
resembled the flash which followed “Fire!” in
the days when he was fighting like the best; and
then all at once he held out his arms instinctively
to save himself, and with a crash his descent was
arrested; and stunned, and bruised, and battered—he
remembered no more.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he came to his senses it was dark, and
the rain pouring in torrents; the lightning had
ceased; the thunder had rolled far away; there
was not a sound to be heard save the rushing of
the rain, and the greedy noise which the dry earth
made as she drank the welcome moisture in. It
was some time before he could remember what
had happened, and then he tried to raise himself,
but fell back shrieking with pain.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>He shouted for help, but if help had been close
at hand, the noise of the pelting rain sweeping
down the mountains would have drowned his
feeble cries. Mercilessly, pitilessly the rain beat
upon him as he lay there powerless. With an
effort he turned his face towards the piece of rock
which had stayed his fall; and while the large
drops fell on his unprotected head, he lay and
thought in a kind of half delirium about the end
that was to be.</p>

<p class='c011'>Was he to die there? Was he to die all alone
on the mountain side with the rain pouring down
upon him, alone in this solitude, amid the darkness
of night? Before now he had lain wounded
on a battle-field, but that had not seemed so desolate
as this. His comrades had sought him out
then, but here no one would dream of looking for
him. His landlord at Grassenfel did not know
where he had gone; he had no one to miss him—to
wonder at his absence; no one in Cumberland—no
one on earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>If Montague Stondon could only imagine where
he was lying, how happy he would be. Was he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>to die thus to gratify him? Was the life-story
(one which had been none too happy) to be
finished thus? How long could he lie there and
live? Was it likely any one would find him?
Would his body ever be discovered, or would it
lie there for the winter’s snows to fall on?—for
the winter’s wind to moan over?</p>

<p class='c011'>If he was not found, how soon could Montague
Stondon take possession of Marshlands? Was
there any chance of making himself heard? How
far down the ravine did he lie? When the
morning dawned he should be able to see. His
arm was broken, he supposed, but the intolerable
pain in his ankle was harder to endure than that.
He tried once again to raise himself, and, spite of
what the effort cost, managed to get his back up
against the rock. He was drenched with rain; a
pool had formed round about where he lay; every
thread of his light summer clothes was saturated;
and yet, though he was shivering with the damp
and the wet, the pain caused by the slightest
movement threw him into a violent heat.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had not strength to keep himself against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the rock, and ere long he slipped back on to the
earth,—back with a jar which made him scream
aloud once more. Then everything grew confused—he
was in India—he was at sea—he was at
home, dreaming of being in some awful peril; he
peopled the mountain sides with shapes of horror;
the darkness did not seem like darkness, for he
could see phantoms and spectres flitting hither
and thither ceaselessly. At last they all came
rushing down on him, but the very horror of the
vision made him recall his scattered senses.
Where was he? What had happened? He
remembered, and then his mind wandered off
afresh. He was a boy again, robbing the first
bird’s nest he had ever despoiled; he was playing
truant, and looking for blackberries with Bob
Sedgemore, and as they passed Farmer Gooday’s
straw-yard they hunted Mrs. Gooday’s favourite
cat with Bob’s terrier up the bank of the little
stream, till the poor thing turned on her tormentors,
when Bob and he stoned her to death.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had not thought about that tortoise-shell cat
for seven-and-forty years. What could make him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>remember her now? The way she stretched out
her legs and turned up her eyes was horrid, and
yet Bob and he had not been affected by the
sight then. Bob merely kicked her into the
stream, after which agreeable interlude they went
on, and ate more blackberries.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bob was dead. He had seen his corpse so
blackened with powder, so maimed, and mangled,
and mutilated, that the mother who bore him
would not have recognised her boy. He was dead—everybody
was dead; the girl he had been
walking with only the other day, as it seemed,
beside the yew-hedge in her father’s garden, was
dead and buried too. People came by their
deaths in every conceivable way, and why should
he not come to his on the side of a Cumberland
mountain, with the wet earth for his bed, and the
rain and darkness for companions?</p>

<p class='c011'>Heavens, how the rain poured down!—how the
dead gathered round about him! There were
the men and women of the long and long ago
walking along the path he had followed from
Tordale. He saw them looking down at him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>through the night. There was his mother; could
she be looking for him? Yes; he could hear her
light footfall on the grass—she was coming to
fetch him. She put her cold hand on his cheek,
and Captain Stondon, with a shout for help,
fainted again.</p>

<p class='c011'>After that he heard, as in a confused dream,
answering shouts coming up the valley; he heard
dogs barking, and people talking, and knew that
he was lifted and carried a long distance to a
house, into which he was borne like a dead
man.</p>

<p class='c011'>He remembered a vain attempt that was made
to get him to swallow something which they held
to his lips. He recollected subsequently the
scared look with which the bystanders started
back at the scream he uttered when an attempt
was made to pull off his right boot; then all became
a blank; for days and days he raved incessantly;
for days his life hung on a thread, and he
knew nothing of the patient care, of the devoted
nursing which brought him back from the Valley
of the Shadow of Death to the morning and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>sunshine of life and health,—from the bleak hill-side
and the cold earth’s breast, to such home
comfort, happiness, and contentment, as through
all the years of his pilgrimage he had never
known.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='c009'>PHEMIE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>After many days Captain Stondon, with the
fever which had prostrated him subdued, awoke
from a quiet sleep, and looked as well as extreme
weakness would permit about the room he
occupied.</p>

<p class='c011'>The apartment was small, clean, and scantily
furnished. There were white curtains to the bed,
white curtains to the latticed windows.</p>

<p class='c011'>Without moving his head, Captain Stondon
could see, over the short muslin blind, the valley
of Tordale stretching away below; he beheld the
mountains bounding the view, and then, remembering
what he had suffered amongst those
mountains, he closed his eyes again, and with a
sensation of luxurious weakness, fell asleep once
more.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>When next he woke it was getting late in the
afternoon, and between him and the window next
the bed there sat a man, whose face he knew he
had seen before. This man was busily engaged
in cleaning a gun, and with a lazy interest
Captain Stondon watched him removing the
barrels, and washing the stock, and going through
the other ceremonies usually performed on an
occasion of the kind. As he rose to leave the
room, in which there was no fire, in order that he
might finish the operation in orthodox fashion
over some live coals, the man glanced at the bed,
and noticing that his patients eyes were open, he
laid down the gun, and, stooping over the bed,
inquired how the invalid felt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am better, I suppose,” Captain Stondon
answered, feebly. “How long?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A fortnight,” was the reply; and straight away
went Mr. Aggland to his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beef tea, Priscilla,” he commanded, “beef tea
of superlative strength and in unlimited quantity.
He is awake and sensible. Yes,” soliloquised
Mr. Aggland, “he has come back to that ‘stage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>where every man must play a part.’ What have
you there? Mutton broth! Let him have some
of that. I did not save him from ‘Such sheets of
fire, such bursts of horrid thunder, such groans of
roaring wind and rain,’ to let him die of starvation
at last.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor’ a mercy, Daniel, how you do talk,” remarked
his better half, as she obeyed his commands.
“Give you your own way, and I believe
you would stew down a bullock for him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And why not, woman?” demanded her husband:
“why not a bullock? What is the life of
a beast in comparison to the life of a man; not
that I myself——” At which point Mr. Aggland,
growing argumentative, was interrupted by a
little scream from his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For any sake, Daniel, don’t turn its mouth
next me! Put it down, or I won’t take up the
broth at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mercy alive! it has not a barrel on it. There
is not a thing about it to go off. It is as harmless
now as my walking-stick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, harmless or not, I can’t a-bear it nigh
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>me,” answered Mrs. Aggland. “I had just as lief
see a lion in the room as a gun. How does the
gentleman seem, Daniel? Has he spoken at
all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but I don’t want him to speak much till
he has eaten. What says Burns?—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>‘Food keeps us livin’,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tho’ life’s a gift no worth receivin’.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Drat Burns!” interposed Mrs. Aggland. “Ay,
and for that matter,” she continued, “drat all
them poets, say I. Here, take the broth, and I’ll
send one of the boys over to Grassenfel in the
morning to see if we can get any beef. Won’t I
go up to him? Not I, indeed. Am I fit, Daniel,
am I fit—I put it to you—to be looked at by any
gentleman? There’s Phemie,—if you want anybody
to go and see him, ask her. She’s always
dressed; she always seems just to have come out
of a bandbox; she has not to go mucking about
like your wife; she is a lady, and can sit in her
parlour. Ask her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will, my dear, as you wish it,” replied Mr.
Aggland, and he went straight into the apartment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>his wife called the parlour, but which was in
reality the living room of the family, where sat
the apple of discord in the Aggland household,
with a pile of needlework before her that it would
have appalled the most skilful seamstress to attack.</p>

<p class='c011'>If that was being a lady, Daniel Aggland
decided then, as he had decided many a time
before, the position was not one to be envied.
Rather the baking and brewing and cooking than
that eternal stitch—stitch! And, moreover,
had not Phemie to do many a thing about the
house besides stitching? Whenever the bread
was best and lightest, had not Phemie kneaded
it? When the butter was the colour of the
daffodil, had not Phemie’s soft, white hands, that
no work made hard or coarse, taken it off the
churn? Who dressed the children, and sent
them clean and tidy off to school? Phemie, to
be sure. Who helped them with their lessons,
and caused the three batches of children (the
Agglands by the first wife, the Agglands by the
second wife, and the Kings, whose mother had
brought them with her to the Cumberland farm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>as her contribution to the general weal) to be
far ahead of all competitors in their respective
classes? Who made and mended for them all?
Phemie. Who sewed the buttons on Mr. Aggland’s
shirts, and kept his clothes in the order he loved?
Why, Phemie still, who now sat with her lovely
hair reflecting back the sunbeams, plying her
needle busily.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was not dressed in the finery to which Mr.
Conbyr had taken exception—finery that had
descended to her from Mrs. Aggland; and there
was so great a contrast between her beauty and
her attire, that Mr. Aggland felt it strike him
painfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>He loved the girl, and would have clothed her
in silks and satins if he could. With the memory
of all that was calmest, and best, and happiest in
his life, she was interwoven; and he would have
liked to make her lot different, if only for the
affection he had borne to the dead woman who
was so fond of her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Further, he admired beauty, and the beautiful,
in his opinion, had no business to be useful likewise;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>for both of which reasons Mr. Aggland, with
his wife’s complaints of Phemie’s “uppishness”
still ringing in his ears, could not help but pause
and look at the girl who, if Mrs. Aggland’s oft-repeated
assertion might be believed, “was not
worth her salt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A really pretty woman always looks prettier
without her bonnet, and Phemie Keller proved no
exception to this rule. The small well-shaped
head with its glory of luxuriant hair, the white
graceful neck, the shell-like ear!—the bonnet
had concealed all these things from Captain Stondon’s
eyes,—and stripped of the old-fashioned
clothes which were her very best, and dressed in
a faded and well-darned mousseline de laine of
the smallest pattern imaginable, which de laine
had likewise descended to her from remote centuries,
with her soft round arms peeping from
below the open sleeves, with her snowy collar
fastened by a bow of dark brown ribbon, Phemie
Keller sitting in the sunshine with the pile of
unfinished work before her, looked every inch
what she was—a lady.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“Will you carry this up to our patient, Phemie?”
said her uncle; and there was a tone in his voice
as he spoke which made the girl look at him wonderingly.
“He is awake now—awake and sensible;
but we must keep plenty of oil in the lamp,
or it will go out after all our trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It won’t go out, uncle, for want of oil while
you are in the house,” she answered, laying down
her work and taking the tray from him. “Duncan
had better run down to the Rectory when he
comes back from school, had he not, and tell Mr.
Conbyr the good news? Do you remember how,
when he was at the very worst, you used to say he
would do us credit yet? Arn’t you proud to have
saved him? I am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That last speech, I am very sorry to say, had a
spice of antagonism in it. Mrs. Aggland had said,
whenever she got tired of the extra fuss and
trouble, that as the man was sure to die any-way,
he might better have died on the hill-side than
in the house of poor folks like themselves, for
which reason Phemie was triumphantly glad that
Captain Stondon had lived, “if only to spite the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>cross old thing,” the latter observation being
made in strict confidence to their only servant,
Peggy M‘Nab.</p>

<p class='c011'>But for Mr. Aggland and Phemie it is indeed
more than likely that Mrs. Aggland’s prophecies
might have been fulfilled, and the pair had certainly
cause for gratulation at the progress made
by their patient.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is positively refreshing to see you getting
on so well,” remarked Mr. Aggland, as he took his
seat by the bedside again, and, the broth having
been swallowed, resumed his gun-cleaning performance;
“but you must not talk much—you
must not talk at all. The less you exert yourself,
and the more you sleep, the sooner you will be
able to go—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

      <div class='line'>‘Chasing the wild deer and following the roe,’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>finished Mr. Aggland, who probably felt at a loss
how to complete his sentence otherwise.</p>

<p class='c011'>In compliance with this advice, Captain Stondon
refrained from speaking, and did not exert himself
at all, unless, indeed, looking with half-closed
eyes at his host could be called exertion.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>To him Mr. Aggland was a never-ending, ever-beginning
source of wonder: dark, wild-looking
hair, that looked as though it had met with some
terrible surprise, hung over a face as strange and
weird as the face of man need to be; hollow
cheeks, thoughtful, greenish-grey eyes, a large
mouth, a nose that seemed all nostril, a ragged
beard, a feeble attempt at a moustache; lines
where lines never appeared in other men’s faces;
a general effect of cleverness and eccentricity. It
was this Captain Stondon took in by degrees, as
he lay between sleeping and waking, listening to
Mr. Aggland humming, in a low falsetto,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Lord my pa-hasture sha-hall prepare,</div>
      <div class='line'>And feed me wihith ha she-heperd’s care.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Many a day afterwards, when he saw Phemie’s
gravity completely upset by her uncle’s melody,
he thought how weak he must have been that
night when he first heard his host speaking in
what he called his “natural language,” music.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='c009'>A COMPACT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>There is an Indian plant which will grow and
flourish in any place, under any circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>Earth it does not ask—care it does not demand.
Cut it off from all apparent means of support, and
it thrives notwithstanding. Detach a leaf from
the parent plant, suspend it by a thread from the
ceiling, and behold! the leaf, receiving all the
nourishment it requires from the atmosphere
alone, puts out roots.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he lay in bed wearily counting away the
long hours of convalescence; as he sat in the
family sitting-room; as he followed his host or
his host’s children slowly around the farm, Captain
Stondon never ceased thinking about that strange
plant, and likening it to Mr. Aggland.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Cut off apparently from all temptation to eccentricity—removed
from contact with a world which,
galling sensitive natures, sometimes produces
curious mental sores and running humours in the
best—earning his bread in a primitive manner,
trying neither to his brain nor to his temper—placed
in a station that seems to have been
removed by Providence further from slight and
aggravation than any other under heaven, Mr.
Aggland was yet peculiar in his manners, habits,
and ideas,—peculiar to a degree.</p>

<p class='c011'>Like the air plant, his oddities were self-supporting
and self-propagating; the older he grew,
the more eccentric he became. Time only increased
his prejudices; years only brought his
peculiarities into more prominent relief; a large
family merely gave him endless opportunities of
airing his pet crotchets, of exhibiting his singular
stock of information. Never by any chance did
he do anything like other people. He had a way
and a fashion of his own—even of sowing seeds in
his garden; and his ideas on the subject of training
and education had produced as singular a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>flock of argumentative children as could have
been found in the length and breadth of “canny
Cumberlan’.”</p>

<p class='c011'>True offspring of the hills—sturdy, self-reliant,
self-opinionated, courageous—the Agglands and
the Kings composed a remarkable household; one
in which, nevertheless, whenever he was able to
rise from his bed and limp about the place, Captain
Stondon speedily found himself at home.</p>

<p class='c011'>His first advances towards acquaintanceship had
been received by the juvenile fry with caution, not
to say suspicion. Distrust of a stranger being,
however, mingled with a feeling that they held
a kind of property in him, that he was the spoil
of their bow and arrow, of their sword and spear,
produced a certain—I cannot say graciousness—but
unbending of their usual ungraciousness in his
favour. They did not know what to make of
this “‘gowk’ who had been so feckless as to miss
t’rod, and go sossing from wig to wa’ down the
hul;” but the very fact of their dog “Davy”
having found the injured man in a “soond,” and
of their father having procured help and brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>him home, and nursed him through his illness,
caused the lads to feel a kind of compassionate
interest in their new friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had been kept so much out of the sickroom
that their curiosity had naturally been excited
likewise. Indeed, Captain Stondon’s first
interview with Duncan, Mr. Aggland’s eldest born,
was held under difficulties, while that young
gentleman stood with the chamber-door half open,
surveying the man who had lain in bed till they
all settled he was never going to rise again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you got anything to say to me, my
lad?” asked Captain Stondon, stretching out one
weak hand towards his visitor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; have you got anything to say to me?”
replied Duncan, clenching the handle of the door
tighter as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know that I have,” answered Captain
Stondon, who was rather taken aback by this
unexpected question. “Did you do well at school
to-day?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You do not care to know that; you have no
lessons to get,” replied Duncan, with the air of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>bird far too old to be caught by such conversational
chaff, but he took a step forward into the
room notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you no dowly lying there so long?” he
asked, after a pause.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you tell me what you mean by dowly, I will
answer your question,” said Captain Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you thinking long? You know what
that is, I suppose,” explained Duncan, who had
learnt the phrase from his Scotch mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not exactly sure that I do; but if you
want to know whether I am tired of being laid
up here, I must answer ‘yes.’ I shall feel very
glad to be out of bed, and walking about once
more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will take you to see the Strammer Tarn, if
you like, when you are well,” volunteered his
visitor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I tell you what it is, Duncan,” broke in
Mr. Aggland at this juncture; “if I ever catch
you here again without my permission, I will box
your ears. Indeed, I have a very great mind to
box them now.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>And straightway the father inflicted condign
punishment on his son, who retired howling from
the apartment, while Mr. Aggland walked to the
window, and looked out, muttering to himself,
half-apologetically—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>“‘Be then to him</div>
      <div class='line'>As was the former tenant of your age,</div>
      <div class='line'>When you were in the prologue of your time,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he lay hid in you unconsciously,</div>
      <div class='line'>Under his life.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Captain Stondon had not the remotest idea
what Mr. Aggland meant by his quotation, but he
knew that the man’s face looked softened and
sorrowful when he turned from the window, and
remarked that “boys would be boys, and that
Duncan was his mother’s son all over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course it was impossible for Captain Stondon
to negative this statement, but he thought
Duncan greatly resembled his father for all that.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will excuse their ill-manners, sir,” proceeded
Mr. Aggland. “They see no one, poor
things. They can learn no better in a wilderness
like this. I do my best to bring them up honest
men and women, ‘fearing God, honouring the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Queen.’ But for anything else! What can I
teach them here in this ‘cell of ignorance,’ as
Guiderius happily calls the country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can teach them what you know, doubtless,”
answered Captain Stondon. “Your education
seems to have been much better attended to
than that of most persons, whether in town or
country; and you can surely impart to your children
a portion at least of that which you once
learnt yourself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Superficial—all superficial,” said Mr. Aggland,
with a sigh. “Here a little, there a little—a
mere smattering of education. Once, indeed, the
fields of learning lay open before me, but I would
not when I could; and you know what is the fate
of people who trifle with their opportunities.
Afterwards I could not when I would; and the
result is that I am here, and my children are here,
and here we shall all remain till the end of the
chapter. The boys, some of them, have fair abilities,
and with good fortune, it is probable they
may eventually——hold the plough well,” finished
Mr. Aggland, abruptly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Truth was, the father had been going to end
his sentence very differently, but feeling that a
stranger could scarcely sympathise with his hopes,
and knowing that, between the future he desired
and the present in which he lived, there was a
gap broad as poverty, he substituted other words
for those he was about to speak, and before
Captain Stondon could reply to his remark,
hastened to change the subject.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should be sorry to go back into the world
again,” he said, “though I do rail at times against
this wilderness, and, like Lamb, consign hills,
woods, lakes, mountains, to the eternal devil. I
abuse nature as men often show their tenderness
by speaking disparagingly of the women they
love best; and I cannot understand the state of
that soul which should find its love of natural
scenery satisfied by the ‘patches of long waving
grass and the stunted trees that blacken in the
old churchyard nooks which you may yet find
bordering on Thames Street.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never was in Thames Street, so far as I
recollect,” remarked Captain Stondon, to whom it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>never occurred that Mr. Aggland was quoting
from a book; “but I do not think the scenery to
be met with there would satisfy me. Nevertheless,
I confess that for the future I shall like
mountains better at a distance. Of one thing I
am positive, namely, that I shall be content hereafter
to admire their beauties from below.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Aggland laughed. “You had a bad fall,”
he said, “and would have had a long lie of it but
for Mr. Conbyr and my dog Davy. Mr. Conbyr
could not rest in his bed till he had sent a man
over on his Galloway to see if you were safely
housed in your inn at Grassenfel; and when the
news came back that you had not been heard of,
nothing would serve him but that I should turn
out and look for you. So Davy and I, and Jack
Holms, started on the search. Mr. Conbyr
wanted to come with us, but I would have none
of him. Davy knew what we were out for as well
as if he had been a Christian.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What breed is he?” interrupted Captain
Stondon: “a St. Bernard?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a bit of it,” answered Mr. Aggland; “he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>something between a Coolie, a Skye, and a Scotch
terrier—but what I cannot tell you. Anyhow, he
knew what we were looking for, and just when
Jack and I thought we must give over the search,
he picks up your hat, sir, and brings it to us in
his teeth. Then we knew you must be somewhere
in the neighbourhood, and Davy hunted
about, smelling up and down till he found you
behind the rock, and a nice pickle you were in
when found. I had no notion but that you were
dead. I tell you honestly now, sir, I no more
expected ever to hear you speak when we carried
you into this house, than I expect the Queen to
send for me and make me an earl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not think I ever should have spoken
much again but for the good care you bestowed
upon me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I flatter myself I am a tolerable nurse,”
replied Mr. Aggland; “’tis a trick I learned in
my early youth. When Mr. Conbyr came here,
wanting to have you carried down to the Vicarage,
I said him gently nay. ‘You’ll excuse me, Mr.
Conbyr,’ I remarked, ‘but out of my house the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>gentleman does not stir till he is fit to make a
choice for himself. You sent him up the hill path,
with a storm brewing, as any child could
have told you, and I brought him off the mountain
side with the rain pouring down heavens
hard: so, with your leave, sir, I’ll e’en see to the
curing of him myself.’ I suppose, however, when
once you are able to limp about on a stick he will
have you away, and then—‘for ever and for ever
farewell.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was the opening Captain Stondon had for
days been anticipating, and seizing his opportunity,
he assured Mr. Aggland he entertained no such
passionate friendship for the clergyman as would
cause him to desert the Hill Farm for the Vicarage.
But at the same time Captain Stondon
hinted that sickness brought its attendant expenses,
that it entailed various and sundry inconveniences;
that, in short, unless Mr. Aggland,
who was blessed with a large family, agreed to
permit the speaker, who had no children, to——</p>

<p class='c011'>“In short,” broke in Mr. Aggland at this point,
“you want to pay me; you are, I presume, rich;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>I am, you presume, poor; and there you chance
to be quite correct. Whatever troubles I have,
I am not ‘perk’d up in a glistering grief;’ I do
not ‘wear a golden sorrow.’ Yes, I am a poor
man. There is no use in my trying to deny the
fact.” And Mr. Aggland took a halfpenny from
his pocket, tossed it in the air, then covered it
over with his hand, and turning towards Captain
Stondon a little defiantly, waited for his
answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not want to pay you,” said that gentleman;
“I never could pay you for the kindness
you have shown me. For my life, for the long
hours you have sat beside my bed, for all you have
done by me, I shall be your debtor always, and I
am not of so thankless a nature that I desire to
be out of your debt. All I meant was, that as
long as a man is alive you cannot keep him for
nothing—you must acknowledge the truth of that
proposition, Mr. Aggland. There is not a child
you have but costs you something every day——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Up went the halfpenny once again, and once
again Mr. Aggland covered it with his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“I, a bachelor,” proceeded Captain Stondon,
“should not be a burden on you, that is all. If
you are willing to let me feel that I am not a
burden, I will stay here, with your leave, till I am
strong enough to go back to my own home; but
if not, I must try to get over to Grassenfel as
soon as may be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For the third time Mr. Aggland spun up the
halfpenny. “Heads thrice running,” he said, and
pocketed the coin gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have won, sir,” was his answer to Captain
Stondon’s speech. “I <em>am</em> a poor man and
money <em>is</em> an object; but for all that, I had rather
luck had turned the other way. So long as there
is independence, there may be friendship even
between a high man and an humble, but once
money passes from hand to hand, adieu to even
the semblance of equality.” And with this speech
Mr. Aggland would have left the room, had not
Captain Stondon detained him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have been a poor man myself,” he said.
“For years life was a continual struggle; and
those years are not so far behind me but that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>can still feel more fellowship with, and friendship
for, a poor man, than a rich. Because I want to
be a little independent, do not think I wish to
prevent your being independent likewise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And with that he held out his hand, which Mr.
Aggland took.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall we be friends?” asked the officer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a question for you to decide,” answered
the other. “I am not a gentleman; I make no
pretension to ever having been one; still—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The rank is but the guinea’s stamp,</div>
      <div class='line'>The man’s the gowd for a’ that.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And straightway it was settled that Captain
Stondon should remain; that he should stay to
be conducted to Strammer Tarn by Duncan; that
he should wait to see Davy, the wisest dog in
Cumberland; that he should not leave the Hill
Farm for the Vicarage, or Grassenfel, or any
other place, till he was strong and well once more;
that he should not, in one word, leave Tordale
till Tordale had become a part of himself—a
place destined to remain green in his memory
all his life long.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='c009'>BY STRAMMER TARN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>It was the middle of October. The September
harvest had been reaped and carried; the sickles
were laid aside for another year, and the barns
were full to overflowing; it was getting late in
the season for any stranger to be lingering among
the hills, but still Captain Stondon remained on
at the Farm contentedly. Had there been no
outside world at all,—had there been no Norfolk
estates, no London clubs, no Paris, no Vienna,—he
could not have seemed better satisfied to stay,
more loth to stir than was the case.</p>

<p class='c011'>Each week, it is true, he said he must soon be
journeying southward; but then each fresh week
found him still loitering across the valley to the
Parsonage; still contemplating the effects of the
autumnal tints on heather, grass, and tree; still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>watching the changing leaves on the branches
that overhung the waterfall; still climbing the
mountain sides, or wending his way to Strammer
Tarn.</p>

<p class='c011'>His arm had knit by this time, and although he
continued to carry a stick, his ankle was almost
strong again. He had drunk in a new draught
amid the hills; he had gone back years, seated
by the ingle nook, wandering among the heather;
he had forgotten the weary years of his lonely
manhood; and he was taking his youth—his
unenjoyed, unprofitable youth—once more in the
autumn of existence, and living it out again,
thoroughly, happily, among the mountains of
Cumberland.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had found rest; he had found contentment.
He had put the gloom of the shadow that formerly
rested over his soul aside, and in that
strange household, surrounded by young people,
by nature, by activity, by life, and hope, and
strength, he grew light-hearted, and with boys
became as a boy, capable of enjoying each day
that dawned upon the earth.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>To be sure, at first he found it no easy matter
either to understand what the lads said, or to
make them comprehend exactly what he said in
return. They had run so wild about the hills;
they had mixed so much with the boys in the
valley; they had grown up so entirely amid Cumberland
sounds and Cumberland associations, that
their every sentence contained some word which
seemed strange and unaccustomed in the ear of
their guest.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, as a rule, Phemie was close at hand to
comprehend and to explain. She it was who told
him what Duncan meant by a “bainer” way to
Strammer Tarn; by a “whang” of bread; by Mrs.
Aggland being in a “taaking,” and by calling
Davy a “tyke.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With her lovely face turned up to his she would
laugh out at his perplexities, and then make darkness
clear before him. She would scold Duncan
in a pretty womanly way for using the Cumberland
dialect, and then “draw him out” for the
officer’s benefit. She would dance over the moors
and the heather, as Duncan sometimes told her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>like a “rannigal,” and then she would sit down
quietly at the edge of the Black Tarn, and talk to
Captain Stondon about her childhood, while she
pulled off her bonnet and wreathed the broom
and the wild flowers into garlands for her hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not an exciting life, but it was peaceful,
without being solitary. Since his boyhood, since
the time which lay almost half a century behind
him, Captain Stondon had never known what it
was to enter any house, not even his own, and to
feel he was crossing the threshold of home. To
rest and be thankful; to live and rejoice; to look
on the merest excursion as a pleasure; to understand
that leisure was never given to man solely
that he might employ his leisure in killing time,—these
things were to Captain Stondon almost
like revelations, and he accepted the new light
and lay down and basked in its glory joyfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>Home! What makes a home, I wonder?
Looking back in the after days to that queer
old Cumberland farm-house across the sea, thinking
of its quiet, and its happiness, even whilst
surrounded by the warmth, and the beauty, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the gaiety of southern climes, Captain Stondon
came to believe that home is not so much one
great fact, as the total of an aggregation of trifles;
that the way the sunbeams steal into the windows,
the particular description of rose that is trained
round the casements, the scent of the honeysuckle
which climbs over the porch, the plan of the
house, the position of the doors, the placing of the
furniture, the eccentricities of the servants, the
tricks of the animals,—all these odds and ends
frame and fit together so as to make one great
and perfect whole, which shall remain stamped on
the memory when the soul has sickened of lordly
mansions, and the brain refuses to remember the
cold bare discomfort of houses that are not homes,
that lack the thousand-and-one charms which oftentimes
form a chain strong enough to bind the heart
of some great man to the lowliest cottage standing
by the wayside of life. It is the sunlight on the
floor, it is the trees that overshadow the roof, it is
the springing of the turf under foot, it is the perfume
of the flowers stealing in through the open
windows, it is the grouping of a circle round a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>blazing fire, it is the tone of the voices, it is
a series of sensations which engross the soul,
and forge fetters around the wisest and the
best.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Hill Farm had every element of home
strong about it. The sunbeams seemed never
weary of shining on it, as if they loved the very
stones in its walls; the roses put out buds and
bloomed even in the frost. There was no such
piece of grass in any nobleman’s park as Mr.
Aggland boasted beneath his parlour windows.
Most part of the year the little garden was a blaze
of flowers, but specially in the autumn the place
seemed on fire with scarlet verbenas and Tom
Thumb geraniums, with nasturtiums, and stately
dahlias, and heliotropes, and fuchsias.</p>

<p class='c011'>The poor man’s flowers, when he takes care of
them, always bloom before the buds burst in the
parterre of his richer neighbour. As though God
loved best him to whom He gives the least, He
seems to send His sun and His rain with richer
blessing to the one than to the other, and the
little crop comes up more abundantly before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>door of the cottager than the great crop is ever
seen to do in the broad fields that are owned by
his landlord and master the squire. It was thus
at any rate with the Agglands—what they planted,
they gathered; what they watered and tended,
grew up to perfection. The great man of Grassenfel,
Lord Wanthorpe, who kept six gardeners,
could not for wages obtain such efficient help as
Mr. Aggland brought round him after school-hours
every afternoon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Delving and digging, watering and wheeling,
clearing and weeding, was fun to the lads—exercise
to their father. With all his quotations, he
did not bring them up in idleness: not one of the
boys but could clean a horse, harness and drive
him, saddle and ride him, as well as any groom in
the country.</p>

<p class='c011'>They could have bought and sold, those lads;
you might have sent them to market, and trusted
their judgment of a drove of beasts as well as that
of any bailiff. They would argue—Duncan more
particularly—with their father, knotty points of
colour, vein, and shape; they would stand with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>their hands in their pockets, and criticise a two-year-old
as gravely as any <i><span lang="fr">habitué</span></i> of Tattersall’s.
They were great on sheep; they were learned
about dogs; occasionally they were pleased to drop
some words of wisdom about hens and chickens for
the edification of Captain Stondon; and concerning
geese and turkeys they were a vast deal better
informed than the person who took charge of
those interesting animals in the poultry yard at
Marshlands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Altogether, brought up in the country, the boys
were <i><span lang="fr">au fait</span></i> in matters appertaining to the
country. They knew all about soils; they spoke
lovingly of manures. In advance of their farming
brethren in the matter of rotation crops, they were
apt, following their father’s lead, to be a little
dogmatical and wearisome on the subject of exhausting
and recruiting the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Aggland piqued himself on having brought
the “best ideas of all nations” into practical use
on his little farm; and the days came when,
knowing more about the man, about the difficulties
he had surmounted, the troubles he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>struggled through, Captain Stondon acknowledged
that, possibly, no other individual could have
made as much of the Hill Farm as Mr. Aggland;
that he had kept a large family well, and brought
them up respectably, where a different father
might have found it a hard struggle to provide
such a tribe of children with dry bread off so bare
and inhospitable a corner of the earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Hill Farm was cheap, the Hill Farm was
picturesque, but it was likewise poor and inaccessible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No man before me was ever able to pay his
rent out of the ground,” said Mr. Aggland, with
excusable vanity; “each successive tenant planted
on the hill, as he would have planted in the valley,
and the result was disappointment and ruin. I,
who had never been a farmer, was looked upon as
a madman for supposing I should succeed where
practical men had failed; but, remembering
Seneca’s axiom, that ‘Science is but one,’ I
laboured on with patience and in hope. And
through all my labour I had pleasure. I have
been happier here than I was in the days when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>my prospects were brighter. Did you ever read
Burns’ ‘Twa Dogs,’ sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>If Captain Stondon had thought saying “Yes”
would have saved him the quotation, he might
have replied falsely; but, knowing that the verse
was sure to come in any case, he answered “No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The poem is neither more nor less than a
comparison between riches and poverty,” explained
Mr. Aggland. “It is a conversation between
two dogs; between one whose</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

      <div class='line'>But surely poor folk maun be wretches.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Was not it, sir, a clever notion putting in the
mouth of a dog the thought that passes so often
through the heart of a man?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what does the other answer?” asked
Captain Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He says with truth that ‘they are nae sae
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>wretched’s ane wad think,’ and then goes on to
what I was going to remark at first,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘An’ tho’ fatigued wi’ close employment,</div>
      <div class='line'>A blink o’ rest’s a sweet enjoyment.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>That was it, sir. After I had done my day’s work
I could enjoy rest as I had never enjoyed anything
in the time when I was idle and earning my
bread easily, and, as I think now, meanly. And
even now I feel it a pleasure to see the seed I
have helped to sow springing up, and bearing
fruit in the Lord’s due season. Although toil has
been my lot, I can sing, with the sweetest of our
modern poets,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘There is not a creature, from England’s king</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To the peasant that delves the soil,</div>
      <div class='line'>That knows half the pleasure the seasons bring,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>If he have not his share of toil.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Look at the farm, sir. It was like moorland when
I came here first, and now I pay my rent and
keep my family off it, and I have a trifle besides
in the Grassenfel Bank. To be sure, if I were to
die, things might go hard with the wife and
children, but there are few in any station who
can do more than support their boys and girls, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>give them education. Duncan certainly might
soon take the farm, and Phemie would help him.
It may be that some day they will make a match,
and then——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The man is come over from Grassenfel about
the sheep, uncle,” interrupted Phemie at this
juncture; and as Mr. Aggland left Captain Stondon
to attend to business, the officer turned and
looked strangely at the girl whose probable future
he had just heard sketched out.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a colour in her face which seemed to
imply that she had heard likewise; but, half-an-hour
afterwards, when she and all her cousins,
Duncan included, accompanied their guest up the
hill and over the heather to Strammer Tarn, her
step was as light and her laugh rang out as clear
as though there were no such thing as marrying
or giving in marriage on earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A nice fate truly,” thought Captain Stondon,
savagely; “to keep a girl like that making butter
and darning stockings all her life. Such hair,
such features, such a complexion, such grace
wasted on a raw-boned Cumberland lout. Great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Heavens! such sacrilege should not be permitted
in a Christian country. What would she like, I
wonder. It might be worth while trying to get
to know what she thinks on the subject.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But, frank as she seemed, what she hoped, what
she feared, what she dreamed, were things Phemie
Keller was never going to tell to Captain Stondon.
In the world she had but one confidante;
the hard-featured, high-cheeked, loud-voice
Scotchwoman, who had been with her from her
childhood, who had come with her from Scotland,
who had served the first Mrs. Aggland, and was
now serving the second, and who loved blue-eyed,
bright-haired, laughing, light-hearted Phemie
Keller with a love passing the love of woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sitting on the boulders that lay near the edge of
the Strammer Tarn, with her cousin Helen’s head
resting on her lap, with the clear October sky
above, with the black rocks frowning on her
girlish beauty, with the dark water at her feet,
Phemie talked to the stranger of everything save
the dreams she dreamed when she lay wide awake
in her little bed at night, save the romantic future
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>she and Peggy sketched out when “croonin’” together
over the winter fire in the kitchen, or
basking in the glorious sunlight of some summer
Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Did he think the girl unconscious of her loveliness?—did
he imagine that, though she might seem
merely “pretty” to her neighbours, Phemie Keller
did not know she was the making of as beautiful
a woman as ever turned men’s heads and caused
honest hearts to ache for love of her? Is not
beauty a talent, and did not she know God had
given her that one talent, at any rate? He had
lived long, and he had seen much, but he fell into
error here. Phemie was fully aware of the extent
of her own charms. All her earlier years she had
been “my bonnie, bonnie bairn” to somebody;
and now her glass, small though it might be, told
the little lady she was beautiful, whilst, if other
proof were wanting, Mr. Conbyr’s entreaties that
she would set her face against vanity, and the
whispered compliments of young Mr. Fagg, the
surgeon, from Grassenfel, should have fully convinced
her of the fact.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>And so while they talked together, and while
Captain Stondon thought he was reading this
girl’s nature as though it were an easy book
Phemie was keeping back the dreams and the
visions that made her young life tolerable to her.
She could sit contentedly at work because airy
castles rose to the sky at her lightest bidding; she
could go about the housework cheerily, thinking
of the future day which was to dawn and free her
from all drudgery and all toil, and she could talk
frankly and naturally to this middle-aged man, who
tried to draw her out because he was as far from her
ideal of a lover, or a husband, or a hero as Mr. Fagg,
or even her hard-headed cousin Duncan himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My father was an officer too,” Phemie was
pleased to explain on the afternoon in question;
“but he was only a lieutenant,—Lieutenant
Keller; I have got his portrait at the farm, if
you would like to see it. He looks so young and
so handsome,” the girl added, with a tremor in her
voice, and she bent her head over her favourite
Helen, touching the child’s dark locks lovingly as
she spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“You resemble him then, doubtless,” suggested
Captain Stondon, gallantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe I do,” she said, apparently without
noticing the implied compliment; “but my mother
was fair too. I remember her with such a colour in
her face that, if people had not known to the contrary,
they would have said she was painted. She
died when she was only one-and-twenty; but I
remember her. Uncle tells me they were both
little more than boy and girl—boy and girl,”
Phemie repeated, with her eyes straining over the
Black Tarn, as though she saw the shadowy forms of
those dead parents standing on the opposite shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>Up to that moment Captain Stondon had taken
Mr. Conbyr’s statement for granted; but now he
began to waver in his faith. If she were really
illegitimate, Phemie’s uncle would never have
spoken to her about her parents so unreservedly;
she would never have been suffered to retain the
portrait of which she had just made mention.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hitherto the question of her birth had been
one studiously avoided by the officer; but suddenly
he became desirous to know all about Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Keller’s parents, and began to insinuate questions
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was her father dead or abroad?” he ventured,
after a pause.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, he died before my mother,” Phemie answered;
“and she never held up her head after,
Peggy says. It was at Malta we were then, and
my mother brought his body back to his own
people, and then returned to her father’s house
with me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why did she not remain with her husband’s
family?” asked Captain Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because they would not have her remain, and
because she thought a Scotch Duncan as good as
an English Keller any day, and would not be
looked down on by them. The Kellers are
great folks somewhere, or think themselves
great folks; and they never forgave my father
for marrying a poor minister’s daughter. He
told her to go to them after his death for
my sake, and she went because he bade
her; but they turned her from the door, and—and——”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Phemie bowed her head and sobbed aloud as
she tried to finish her sentence. She had heard
her mother’s wrongs so often spoken of,—she had
heard Peggy M‘Nab tell so pathetically how that
young creature, repulsed by her husband’s kindred,
had travelled home to the old manse to die,
that she could not speak without weeping as she
recalled the story.</p>

<p class='c011'>Home to die! home to the familiar places she
had left so few years before to look her last on
them ere she passed from earth for ever;—home
to the lonely manse by the desolate sea-shore;—home
to the well-remembered rooms where she
could lie and listen to the long roll of the Atlantic
waves as they came booming up against the rocky
coast;—home to the haunts and the friends of
her girlhood;—home—or, as Peggy said so plaintively—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hame, hame, puir thing, to dee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie could not talk of it calmly; Phemie
could scarcely talk of the manse itself calmly, let
alone of her mother; and whilst Captain Stondon
retraced his steps towards Tordale in the gathering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>twilight, with Duncan and Helen and Phemie
beside him, and the other children running on
towards home as fast as their little legs could
carry them, he made up his mind to have some
talk with Mr. Aggland, and discover how he might
best advance that eccentric individual’s views,
and do something at the same time for Phemie
Keller.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='c009'>THE AGGLAND INTERIOR.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>The short October day was drawing to a close
when the party reached home; and it had grown
so dark by the time they reached the Hill Farm,
that candles were lighted and curtains drawn, and
the tea-things set, awaiting their arrival. Amazingly
cozy looked the parlour, with sofa pulled
round beside the fire, a steaming kettle on the
hob, and coals piled high blazing up the chimney.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though the furniture was of the plainest, the
room seemed homelike and cheerful to Captain
Stondon, who was greeted by Mr. Aggland with—</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must have found Strammer Tarn unusually
attractive this afternoon. Were you
watching ‘Autumn like a faint old man sit
down—by the wayside a-weary?’ Have you
brought an appetite back with you from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>hills? Mr. Conbyr has been here begging that
you will dine with him to-morrow. So, in common
courtesy, you are in for two sermons—two of <em>his</em>
sermons—good lack! Nevertheless ’tis a good
man ‘Gray, with his eyes uplifted to Heaven.’ I
do think Mr. Conbyr does try to keep both eyes
and soul uplifted; for which reason I make the
children write down his sermons as well as they
can after they come from church. In a literary
point of view, what he says may not be super-excellent,
but the words of a good man must
always hold something worth remembering. Now,
Phemie, let us have some tea,” finished Mr. Aggland,
with the air of a person who felt that, having
delivered himself of a Christian sentiment, he
deserved some refreshment after it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dutifully obedient, the girl poured out the tea,
and when he had handed a cup to his wife, who
sat knitting by the fire, and another to Captain
Stondon, who was contemplating Phemie, Mr.
Aggland duly and solemnly stirred up the sugar
from the bottom, and then tasted the infusion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wormwood! wormwood!” he exclaimed, surveying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>the tea with astonishment and Phemie
with reproach. “There’s rue for you,” he added,
turning to Captain Stondon, “and here’s some for
me. We may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays,
but it is quite a different matter to drink it any
evening in the week. What the deuce, child,
have you done to it? Salts and senna—soda and
bark! ugh!” and Mr. Aggland began putting all
the cups back on the tray.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will keep mine,” said Mrs. Aggland defiantly.
“If yours does not please you, have some more
made. As Phemie was out wasting her time as
usual on the hills, I wet the tea; but I won’t wet
it again—what I brew never contents you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Having concluded this pleasant sentence, Mrs.
Aggland resumed her knitting, while Mr. Aggland,
having muttered something that sounded
very like “Damn the tea!” directed his conversation
towards his guest, who had long doubted the
prudence of the farmer’s second choice, and who
felt more and more convinced of the fact of its
imprudence every day he passed in the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not a virago was Mrs. Aggland; not a noisy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>headstrong, passionate woman. There was no
quarrelling and making up with her. She did
not fly into a passion one moment, and calm
down the next. She simply “nagged.” There is
no other word that I know of to express her mode
of proceeding, or I would use it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Man could not delight her, nor woman neither,
if the man and the woman chanced to be of her
own household. From the time she rose in the
morning till she laid her pinched, discontented
face on the pillow at night, the thing was never
done, by child or adult, that pleased her; and the
person who seemed able to displease her most was
Phemie Keller.</p>

<p class='c011'>In her youth, which takes us back to a somewhat
remote period, Mrs. Aggland had been
reckoned rather a beauty by the young men in
her own class of life. She was a belle of the
genteel sentimental style; laced tight, minced
her words, drank vinegar to keep herself pale,
wore her ugly drab hair in curls, held her head on
one side, simpered like a fool when spoken to,
and was altogether a superior young person, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>married, in her two-and-thirtieth year, Mr. King,
a struggling grocer in Lancaster.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. King survived the unhappy event for five
years, at the end of which time he died, leaving
her a small business and four children. When or
how Mr. Aggland first became acquainted with
the widow, he never informed his neighbours.
All any one could say for certain was, that he
took her to wife, and that she brought him some
money and the children aforesaid. So much the
world knew; but Mr. Aggland knew, besides,
that he had made a bad bargain, an irreparable
blunder, that life had been a harder struggle with
him than ever during the six years which had
elapsed since his second marriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were already three young pledges of
affection—two aged five years, and a burly child
just able to run about alone—born to him of this
ill-assorted union.</p>

<p class='c011'>What the future held, it might be difficult for
him to say, but if it held many more children,
Mr. Aggland confessed to his own heart that the
prospect was not inviting. Had it not been for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Phemie, he scarcely knew how the house would
have gone on at all; and Mrs. Aggland hated
Phemie for reasons which I am about to tell.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Aggland had been a beauty relatively,
Phemie was a beauty positively. Mrs. Aggland
had taken pains to make and keep herself
“genteel.” Without any arts or devices Phemie
looked a lady even in her aunt’s cast-off finery.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Aggland had been given to melody in her
younger days. Her rendering of pathetic songs,
such as, “Oh! no, we never mention her,” “The
Soldier’s Tear,” “The Banks of Allan Water,” and
others of the same stamp, had won for her immense
applause from her numerous admirers.
The high note in the “Banks of Allan Water,”
and the <i><span lang="it">rallentando</span></i> passage in the “Soldier’s
Tear,” when very softly and with the help of
quavers and semi-quavers the tear is wiped away,
used always to produce a sensation, and it was
therefore no wonder that Mrs. Aggland resented
Phemie’s voice as a personal injury, and detested
her for possessing it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even the children liked best to hear their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>cousin sing. They would leave the “Lass of
Gowrie” for “Love’s Ritornella,” and “Young
Lochinvar” for “Allan-a-dale.” It is not given
to every <i><span lang="it">prima donna</span></i> to make way for a
younger comer gracefully, and Mrs. Aggland was
only human; for which reason, it may be, she
would not have repined against the decrees of
Providence if Phemie had caught bronchitis and
lost her voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Further, though Mrs. Aggland had brought her
husband some small dowry, she had brought him
incumbrances likewise; and this girl—this Hagar
in the household—this Mordecai at the gate—possessed
her trifling portion too, a hundred
pounds, the principal and interest and compound
interest of which were to be hers on
coming of age, or on marriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Aggland could have used the money had
he liked—taken it in payment for her board and
lodging; but he had settled that not even in their
blackest distress was the girl’s “tocher” to be
touched, and the money was kept intact accordingly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Heaven help us! Perhaps the man had more
than hoped she and Duncan would spend it
together, and try and stock a small homestead
for themselves, where he could visit them, and
smoke and quote and sing in peace.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had he any other dream? Did he think that
Duncan, with his turn for mechanics, with that
passion for making a pump and a steam-engine
which seems to be the besetting sin of English
lads—the snare and the delusion that Satan in
these latter days has devised for the disappointment
and confusion of parents—with his dogged
perseverance, and his intensely Scotch hardheadedness,
might rise to eminence in the
future? Perhaps that was the reason why he
kept the boy at school long after the age when
most farmers’ sons had completed their education
and relapsed into boorishness for ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Aggland was so fond of talking about Watt,
Arkwright, Strutt, Foley, Petty, and a number of
other self-made men, as to suggest the idea that
far away down in his heart he was nourishing
ambitious hopes concerning his eldest son’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>worldly advancement. One thing, however, was
certain. He wanted Phemie and Duncan to grow
up into lovers and to marry in due time, for which
reason he encouraged the visits of none of the
young men who would perhaps have thought
themselves good enough to aspire to the hand
of Miss Keller; and consequently Miss Keller
had heard as few compliments and blushed as
little at pretty rustic speeches as the strictest
matron could have desired.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nevertheless Phemie knew she was pretty, and
so did Mrs. Aggland, which mutual knowledge by
no means conduced to the maintenance of peace
and quietness between the pair.</p>

<p class='c011'>Moreover, Phemie was far more clever than
Mrs. Aggland; more clever and quick not merely
at catching up book learning, but at needlework,
at household duties, and in all other practical
affairs. Given opportunity, there could be no
doubt but that the girl would have been as accomplished
and well-informed as she was pretty.
Even as matters stood, she had got a curious
smattering of knowledge into her head. She had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>read and re-read all the books in her uncle’s
singularly miscellaneous library. He had taught
her what he knew of French; she had learned to
play the guitar almost without his help; and Mrs.
Aggland, looking askance, prophesied that such
“goings on,” “such ways,” “such notions,” would
bring Phemie to ruin; while there were not a few
in the neighbourhood—Mr. Conbyr himself, worthy
man, amongst the number—who sympathised with
Mrs. Aggland, and thought Phemie was being
fairly spoiled by her eccentric and imprudent
uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Even to the making of the tea,” muttered
Mrs. Aggland, as she went on with her knitting,
and with one light-coloured eye watched Phemie
pouring out the fresh infusion, “I might as well
be nobody. He had better never have married at
all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Which was undeniably true; at any rate, he
had better never have married at all than married
her, and he was perhaps thinking something of
the kind even while he went on talking to Captain
Stondon about indifferent subjects.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>All at once Mrs. Aggland broke into the conversation.
She did not like being left on one side
so completely. Even the pleasure of indulging
her bad temper, and seeing other people uncomfortable,
was dearly purchased at the price of such
neglect; therefore, when Captain Stondon was
making some remarks about the loneliness and
desolation of Strammer Tarn, she laid down her
knitting, a sure sign of truce, and observed that
she had not seen Strammer Tarn. “I have never
been to Grassenfel since I came home to this
house,” she said; “except to church once in a
way, and to a chance prayer-meeting at a neighbour’s,
I never set foot across the threshold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You find so many home occupations, doubtless,”
suggested Captain Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and it is the children,” she replied.
“Where there is so much work to be done, and
so few to do it, where there are so many mouths
to fill, and so much planning needed to fill them,
it stands to sense I can’t be running over the hills
like a girl. I can’t leave things to go to wrack
and ruin by themselves.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“I am certain,” said Captain Stondon, gallantly,
“that nothing can go to ruin in the same house
with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sure it is very good of you to think so.
It is not every one that would say as much, though
I do work early and late, though I can say with a
safe conscience I never eat the bread of idleness,”
remarked Mrs. Aggland, darting a look towards
her husband, who coolly said:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you mean me, Prissy, my dear, you are
quite mistaken. I am willing to say all Captain
Stondon said, and more; I am willing to say all
you said, and more. You rise early, you take
your rest late, you do not eat the bread of idleness,
you eat that of carefulness—what more?
‘The man in the world who shall report he has a
better wife, let him in nought be trusted.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Capital, Mr. Aggland! a most happy quotation,”
remarked Captain Stondon. For Phemie’s sake;
for Phemie, who was now out of the room putting
the younger children to bed, he wanted to throw
oil on the waters, to calm the tempest that had
literally arisen in a teapot.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Many a one wondered,” went on Mrs. Aggland,
“how I ever could think of marrying again after
losing the kind, good, blessed husband, for which
I were a-wearing weeds when I met with Mr. A.
And, most of all, how I ever came to marry a man
with children. I had made up my mind never to
leave off widow’s caps no more. I had set down
my foot against matrimony and every folly of the
sort, when Mr. Aggland came and persuaded me
to change my mind. To hear him talk now sometimes,
nobody would think he had tried so hard to
get me, for I had a’most sworn never to put a
step-father over my boys; but you see, sir, what
it is to be tempted,” and Mrs. Aggland executed
an idiotic giggle, while Captain Stondon answered:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“See, rather, madam, what it is to be tempting.”
Which speech put the <i><span lang="fr">ci-devant</span></i> beauty into a
seventh heaven of good temper, and straightway
the pair began a little skirmish of assertion and
retort.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He, the captain, was only making fun of an
old woman like herself.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“No, upon his honour, he had merely stated a
self-evident fact.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ten years before she might have been, at least
some folks had said so; but now, with a growing-up
family about her——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She failed to rate herself as highly as her
friends did,” put in Captain Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The care of children soon put all those kind
of foolish notions out of a woman’s head; not that
even in her youngest days she had been given to
vanities, and now she was a mother——</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Captain Stondon,” she finished pathetically,
“<em>you</em> don’t know what it is to be a
mother——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And he doesn’t want to know, I am sure,”
interrupted Mr. Aggland; which statement was so
incontrovertibly true, that the officer could not for
the life of him help laughing at his host’s way of
putting things.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then Phemie re-entered the room, carrying
a bonnet in one hand and her workbox in the
other. Having her little vanities too, she had
asked a neighbour to bring her some ribbon from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Grassenfel, and her heart was set on trimming her
bonnet that very Saturday night with the laudable
view of wearing it the next morning in
church.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no absolute sinfulness, we will
conclude, in this desire; but Mrs. Aggland
fired up on the spot to denounce such wickedness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was it not enough that she had wasted her
whole afternoon? Was she going to waste the
evening as well? With a hole in Duncan’s
jacket; with the pockets in her uncle’s coat like
sieves; with Helen’s plaid dress wanting lining;
with all the children needing stockings mended
for the morrow, was she going to sit down and
make up finery for herself? She, Mrs. Aggland,
wondered how Phemie could have the face to go
to church after such selfishness. She wanted to
know what her Maker would think of her when
He saw her sitting there with new trimmings on
her bonnet, and the children’s toes, poor dears,
coming through their socks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Phemie mended twenty pairs this morning,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>said Duncan, who had followed his cousin into the
room; “I counted them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then she can get to Helen’s frock,” answered
Mrs. Aggland.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now let’s have an end of this,” broke in Mr.
Aggland, angrily. “I won’t have the girl made a
slave of by anybody. Go on with your bonnet,
Phemie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the beauty had been taken off the ribbons
for the girl. She could not see them for tears;
and so, putting all her little finery aside, she assured
her uncle that she did not care, that her
work could wait, that she had forgotten Helen’s
frock, and would rather do it.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she spoke, with the tears just trembling in
her voice, with her pretty hands putting the lace,
and ribbons, and net hurriedly on one side, with
her head bent down so that no one might see she
was crying, Mr. Aggland suddenly caught Captain
Stondon looking earnestly at her with an expression
in his face which made the farmer’s heart
stand still.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man loved her! and if winter’s snows had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>covered the green wheat in May, Mr. Aggland
could not have been more shocked or more surprised.</p>

<p class='c011'>For this he was staying among the hills—for this
he was putting up with such poor accommodation
as the farm afforded—for this he was complimentary
to Mrs. Aggland—for this he had a pleasant
word for every man, woman, and child about the
place.</p>

<p class='c011'>For this—— How could he have been so blind?
how could he have been such a fool? What was
Mrs. Aggland’s scolding in comparison to such a
discovery? As to sit and talk without making a
fool of himself till he had leisure to think over the
matter, it was not to be attempted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps your aunt will give you a holiday to-night,
Phemie?” he said; “and let us have some
music.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Mr. Aggland who spoke; but his voice
sounded so strange and altered, that every one in
the room turned and looked at him with involuntary
surprise. Even his wife was astonished into
saying that if Phemie had done the socks, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>other things could “let be;” while Captain Stondon,
reading in his host’s face something of what
was passing within, woke at the same moment to
a vague kind of comprehension that he had dug
up his heart from the dead woman’s grave, that
he had swerved from the old allegiance at last,
and that he was as hopelessly in love with a pair
of bright eyes, with a glory of auburn hair, with
a young, young girl, as the most foolish lad of
nineteen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well! well! a man may catch a fever at any
age. There is no law in the Statute Book, as far
as I am aware, which forbids or prevents his
doing so.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime Duncan fetched in his father’s violin,
and Duncan’s brother, Donald, together with
Helen Aggland and John and Prissy King, came
trooping into the room laden with music-books.
By degrees a younger Aggland and two more
Kings straggled out of the kitchen into the parlour,
and if the other children had not been satisfactorily
tucked up in bed, they would have
toddled down stairs also to hear “the singing.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>When a man’s natural language chances to be
music, like Mr. Aggland’s, the household generally
is apt to hear a little more melody than proves
agreeable. At the Hill Farm, however, everybody’s
language seemed to be music. Peggy
crooned Scotch ballads all day long in the kitchen;
Mrs. Aggland’s shrill treble was to be heard uplifted
in “The Maid of Llangollen,” “He was a
Knight of low degree,” and other songs of the
same style and period. Duncan for everlasting
was shouting out, “Sing, sing, sing—who sings?”
which performance he occasionally varied with
“The Pilgrim Fathers,” while the lesser fry chirped
out snatches of old airs, mixing up hymns and
Jacobite tunes in the strangest way imaginable.
Mr. Aggland himself generally went through his
daily duties to the tune of “The Hundredth
Psalm,” and swore at his refractory labourers
between the bars.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All people that on earth” was, accordingly,
what he selected to lead off with when he had
screwed up his violin, and his wife kindly took the
treble, which would perhaps have sounded all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>better had she not occasionally interrupted her
performance to box some of the children’s ears, to
“drat their noise,” and to wonder if any woman
ever was so plagued as she. With the tears wiped
off her cheeks, with her lovely eyes bright as ever,
Phemie, stitching away at Helen’s frock, sometimes
interposed a sweet second, sometimes, when
her sense of the ludicrous was touched, looked
mischievously across at Captain Stondon, and made
him smile and turn away his head in spite of
himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What the devil are you about, Prissy!” was
one of Mr. Aggland’s most usual sentences in the
middle of a hymn; and when every now and then
he hit Duncan a rap over the head for singing a
false note, the punishment tested the officer’s
gravity severely.</p>

<p class='c011'>It would have been a curious scene that for
any stranger to look in on. By the fire sat Mrs.
Aggland, with her cap a little awry, with the corners
of her eyes drawn down, with her mouth wide
open, with her head on one side. Excepting Mr.
Aggland, no one, I think, ever pulled such absurdly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>ugly faces while singing as the mistress of the Hill
Farm; but the master eclipsed her; every hair
on his head quivered as he sang; not a muscle
remained still as he shook, and quavered, and indulged
in extempore roulades. The way he swung
himself about, the manner in which he swayed
from side to side, the perfect desperation with
which he sang, the earnestness with which he
cursed,—these things all tended to make Phemie
misbehave herself, all conduced to fits of coughing,
and to suspicious attention to Helen’s frock.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ech, Lord save us!” Peggy was ejaculating in
the kitchen; “Maister ’ull burst his pipes, surely.
He ought to bring roun’ the forty-foot ladder if
he wants to get up to that. My certy, he is at it
again!” And Peggy absolutely paused in her
work to listen.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little back from the fire sat Captain Stondon,
with a batch of the children round him, thinking
of the long ago past, of the pleasant, yet fleeting,
present. For his years he was a young-looking
man; he carried his fifty-five summers lightly,
and stooped no more under them than if fifteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>had been subtracted from their number. India
had not aged him. There was still about him
something of the same dash and <i><span lang="fr">bonhommie</span></i>
which had won friends and gained love for the
young lieutenant of, say, thirty years before. His
brown hair was as yet unmixed with grey, his
light-blue eyes had not lost their keenness of
vision, their honesty of expression. If there was
nothing romantic about his appearance, there was
something which yet made any one with whom he
came in contact feel instinctively that he was true;
if he was not handsome, he was not plain. He
looked like what he was, an English squire, of
good birth, in easy circumstances, strong, hearty,
middle-aged. He had grown younger since he came
to the Hill Farm. Perhaps the children climbing
up his knees, perhaps the total rest, perhaps
the long idle days spent in watching Davy stand
on his hind legs smoking; in seeing Duncan getting
bare-back on unbroken colts, and gallop them
round the fields; in laughing at the tosses the
younger fry got while riding a favourite ram and
an ill-conditioned calf up and down the paddock;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>and in wandering over the hills to Strammer Tarn,
had contributed to this result: but in any case
the fact was undeniable, Captain Stondon had retrograded
in years; and if all went on well, he
bade fair to retrograde a few more. He would
have liked the singing to continue for ever, so
that he might look at Phemie’s white hands, and
snowy neck, and pretty face, without let or hindrance.
But all earthly things must come to an
end; and after Mr. Aggland had indulged the company
with the serenade from “Don Pasquale”
solo, and the assembled congregation had sung the
“Evening Hymn,” in no one line of which Phemie
could join, for fear of laughing out loud at her uncle,
the concert would have concluded, but for this.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Johnny,” whispered Captain Stondon to one
of the young Kings while the “Evening Hymn”
was still in progress, “get your cousin to sing
something alone to the guitar, and I will send you
down the strongest knife I can find in London—one
with four blades. Ask her yourself, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Whereupon the young imp struck his closed
mouth with his hand, and the moment Mr. Aggland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>put aside the violin, began tormenting Phemie
for one song—only one—only—only—only——</p>

<p class='c011'>Which request Captain Stondon seconded, of
course, and Duncan then joined in, telling their
guest he should hear Phemie singing “Alice
Gray.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You just ought;” he added, a sentence that of
course raised the officer’s curiosity to fever pitch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I may never hear it,” he pleaded, “if you do
not sing it to-night, for I shall probably have to
leave early in the week;” and thus urged, Phemie,
blushing a good deal, took the guitar, and after
tuning it began—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“She’s all my fancy painted her,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She’s lovely, she’s divine;</div>
      <div class='line'>But her heart it is another’s,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And it never can be mine.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet loved I as man never loved,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A love without decay—</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! my heart, my heart is breaking</div>
      <div class='line in2'>For the love of Alice Gray.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>I dare say there are few who read these pages
that know anything of the old ballads which were
sung by the grandmothers of the present generation.
New words and new music have succeeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>to the simple airs and the homely verses that yet
had strength enough in them to make many a
man’s heart throb faster as he heard; and it is very
rarely—once in a dozen years or so—that any one
strikes the well-remembered chords and wakes
the old harmony once more. Half a lifetime had
gone over Captain Stondon’s head since the ballad
Phemie Keller sung had sounded in his ears before;
but the years seemed to fade away from
his memory as he listened, and he was young
again, sitting back in a crowded drawing-room,
that he might hide the tears he could not help
shedding. Ah me! ah me! that men’s hearts
should keep so young, whilst their bodies grow so
old—that the pains of youth should stay with us
when the hopeful buoyancy of youth is gone—that
a touch should make the blood flow out fast
as ever, when there is no sap left behind to enable
the bare tree to put forth green leaves and bright
buds of promise—that tears should well up into
the eyes when the capacity for smiling has left
the lips—that we should live through all the fever
and trouble, and fret and worry, we thought left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>so far behind, at the tone of a voice, at the sound
of an air.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man’s heart had not broken then; was it
to be broken now?</p>

<p class='c011'>Had he kept the toy, defaced and battered
though it might be, all these years, to the end that
a girl should destroy it at last? Was it only the
olden memories that made him pause for a moment
ere he thanked Phemie for her song? Was
it not rather that a new Alice Gray had crossed
his path, more fair, more divine, than the Alice
Gray of old? A young, fresh, ingenuous Alice,
with the truest eyes, the most exquisite hair, the
most heavenly voice, man had ever conceived of?
If he should love this Alice, would his heart not
break? With nothing before, with everything
behind him, what would the hereafter of his life
prove, if he had to leave that sweet face amid the
Cumberland hills while he went back again into
the dreary, lonely world, solitary and objectless.
He would win her love, he would make her love
him. Surely his position, his wealth, his personal
appearance, his manners, were far above anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Miss Keller was likely to meet with at the Hill
Farm. He would be so good to her and hers; he
would be so tender with her, so thoughtful, that for
very gratitude she must learn to love him. He
would take her away, he would show her foreign
countries, he would surround her with every luxury.
She should walk “in silk attire.” Rich and rare
should be the gems wherewith he would deck
her; life to her should be as a fairy tale; money
and lands would be of value to him at last;
everything he possessed—name, station, wealth—should
be put to a use for her—for this Cinderella,
whom he meant to convert into a princess,
if it pleased her to let him do so. All the old
tales, all the old ballads, came into his head the
wrong way at the same moment, for alas! <em>he</em> was
the rich suitor, and not the young penniless wooer;
it was <em>he</em> who was thinking of offering the “rigs of
land, the sheep and the kye, the gowd and the
siller,” which never ought to be owned by fortunate
lovers. He was reading the poems of all
times with an inverted meaning, and he might
have gone to bed that night happy, and dreamed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the sweet dreams of the long and long ago but
for Mr. Aggland.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Phemie,” said that gentleman, with a certain
viciousness of manner, “since you have sung
about one of the Grays for Duncan, will you sing
about another for me? ‘Auld Robin,’ my dear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>What were the officer’s thoughts after that, as
he lay awake counting the weary hours that
seemed to him to be walking slowly and lingeringly,
like living things, backwards and forwards,
over the eternal hills?</p>

<p class='c011'>My reader, I scarcely know; but one thing is
certain, that they were only a degree more bitter
than those indulged in by Phemie’s uncle, who,
with eyes wide open, watched through the darkness
his air castle vanishing away.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='c009'>ALL THE DIFFERENCE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“You are right,” said Mr. Aggland. “Home-keeping
youth have ever homely wits;” but the
sentence did not flow glibly off his tongue, and
the farmer stood for a moment after he had answered
Captain Stondon, looking with his outward
eyes it is true down the fair valley of Tordale, but
trying with his mental vision to penetrate into
the future which had suddenly become so misty
and uncertain.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was early in the week following that Saturday
night when knowledge had come to two at
least of the party at the Hill Farm. Captain Stondon
was going to spend a few days at the Rectory
before turning his back on Cumberland, and ere
leaving the man who had been his friend in such
sore need, he was trying to show his gratitude for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the past, and to secure Mr. Aggland’s services in
the future—a double purpose which fettered his
speech a little, and placed at once a certain embarrassment
between himself and his host.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was pleading to be allowed to do something
for Duncan; to be permitted to hold out a helping
hand at this the turning point of his whole
life.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has abilities,” remarked Captain Stondon.
“Why should he not have an opportunity of
turning them to account? He has brains; why
keep him here, where he will never have a chance
of making a fortune out of them? Let the boy
go away and see the world. He will learn more
in six months outside these mountains than he
could learn in as many years under their shadow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And in reply Mr. Aggland remarked, as already
stated: “You are right. Home-keeping youth
have ever homely wits. And yet——” he proceeded
after a moment’s pause, “judging from
my own experience, I think it better for people
who must content themselves with an humble
sphere, never to be lifted above it. It is happier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>to be independent than rich; it is a fine thing to
rise in the world, but it is a cursed thing to be
patronised. My opinion is, that a man worth
calling a man, ought to be able to say he owes all
he owns, all he has enjoyed, to no other man
living,—only to God and himself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But God makes men his instruments,” suggested
Captain Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He may; but I doubt it,” replied Mr. Aggland;
“at least, I think we have no right to say
the instruments we deliberately choose for ourselves
were put in our way by the Almighty.
Look at me. Should not I have been a happier
man had no one ever said to me, ‘Come out of
your station, and be a gentleman, Aggland?’ A
gentleman, good lack, a gentleman?” and the
farmer drew his hand up and down the sleeve of
his threadbare coat, and looked at his patched
shoes, at his coarse grey stockings, at his well-worn
trousers, contemptuously as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Should you dislike telling me your story?”
asked Captain Stondon, after a moment’s hesitation.
“Pardon me, if I seem impertinent; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>your boy’s case might be anything rather than
analogous to your own.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are right again,” was the reply, “since
no two lives are ever precisely analogous, and yet
each man who precedes us leaves his warning
signal behind, showing where possible danger is
lurking. Now, my life was cursed by patronage;
and you offer patronage to my lad. You see my
argument? My story, certainly. I will tell thee
tales—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Of woful ages long ago betid:’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I will tell you the ‘lamentable fall of me,’ albeit
it may be—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘A tale told by an idiot,</div>
      <div class='line'>Signifying nothing.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Let me be the judge of that,” answered
Captain Stondon, smiling in spite of himself;
“let me hear your experience first, and then we
can talk of Duncan’s future afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must begin at the beginning, I suppose,”
said Mr. Aggland. “If you are not weary, shall
we walk along the hill path while we talk?
Where was I? oh, at my own birth, which happened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>on the sixth of April, eighteen hundred
and one; you can reckon that up, sir, hereafter,
and find how old a man I am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The blow was not intended, but Captain
Stondon winced. He had made his <i><span lang="fr">début</span></i> on this
world’s stage on the fourteenth of June, seventeen
hundred and ninety, and it did not take
him long to calculate how much older than Mr.
Aggland that fact made him. Meantime the
farmer proceeded:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was not born of prosperous parents; I was,
on the contrary, born in ‘poverty’s low barren
vale,’ which is not nearly so desirable a vale to
inhabit as poets usually imply. My father was a
country schoolmaster, one who might have sat to
Goldsmith for his picture. He loved children, he
loved teaching, he loved learning; but neither
teaching, learning, nor children brought him
much money. I can see him now,” went on Mr.
Aggland; “see him sitting just where the sunbeams
had cleared a space out for themselves in
the middle of the dusty floor. The boys and
girls are all quiet at their sums; he is holding a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>slate, and explaining the Rule of Three to a child
who stands beside him. That child was myself.
I never knew him to be other than patient and
gentle with me, for I was the youngest of a
large family, the Benjamin of his age to him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Aggland paused. For a moment the Cumberland
hills faded from his eyes, and the old
home, left so long before, yet remembered so
distinctly, arose out of the years, and stood by
the roadside, with the elder-tree shading it, with
the duck-pond in front of it, with the half-acre of
garden all a-glow with flowers surrounding it.
He could see the sycamore under which he had
lain whilst conning his Virgil and labouring
through Ovid; and then the whole vision passed
away, and he was looking at the reality of his
life on a fine October morning, with Skillanscar
and Helbeck towering to the sky, and the man
whose life he had saved amongst those very rocks
and crags walking beside him, waiting for him to
proceed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He knew more than is usual with persons of
his class,” went on Mr. Aggland, “and he taught
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>me to love learning as he did—to love it for its
own sake, not for the sake of any money it might
bring, of any advantage that might accrue from
it. What he meant me to be, whether a schoolmaster
like himself, or a clerk, or a labourer, I do
not know, for at sixteen I had the misfortune to
meet with a rich gentleman who took an interest
in me. It happened in this way. My father had
a brother living in a little seaport in Wales. He
was a tailor, and pretty well to do, and he used
to make us welcome to spend a week with him
every summer, as the holidays came round. It
was the last day of our stay, and I was hanging
about the shore loth to leave the sea, for I loved
it, when all at once there was a cry and a shout,
and I saw a boy who had been bathing washed
away by a wave and disappear. I guessed in a
minute how it was; the lad had gone out beyond
his depth, and could not swim. There were
places where the sea deepened suddenly, and he
had dropped on one of them. I did not know
who he was, and if I had it would have made no
difference; one life is as valuable as another I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>think now, and I suppose I thought the same
then, if I thought at all. One boy is as good as
another, whether he be the son of a king or the
son of a peasant. I did not know who he was,
and God is witness that, not knowing, I risked
my life to save him willingly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you did save him?” asked Captain
Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I ran a race with the sea for him,” answered
Mr. Aggland, a flush overspreading his hollow
cheeks; “I fought for him, I got mad with the
waves for trying to beat me out. Though it is
thirty years since—thirty years within a trifle—I
can remember, as if it was but yesterday, looking
out over the waves seaward, and thinking I could
follow him to Ireland, if need were, sooner
than the waters should beat me. He went down
twice. As he rose the third time I had him. I
stretched my arm out over a wave and caught
him. I could not have brought him back to
land; but looking over the water, <em>not</em> towards
Ireland this time, I saw help coming; and I kept
him up till we were both pulled into the boat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>that had pushed off after me. I liked the sea up
to that minute, sir; I have hated it ever since. I
could not put into words what I thought about it
as I struggled to keep him and myself afloat till
the boat came. I have never had a bad illness
since, when that minute has not been reproduced
for my benefit. I suppose it was fear came over
me; but I seemed to be in the power of some
cruel enemy, with whom I could not reason,
against whom I could not struggle; I felt as if I
was alone in the world out there—alone with the
waters round and about me. I remember trying
to hold on by the waves, and then after that
there was a blank.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did they recover both of you?” asked
Captain Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes—but they had hard work bringing the boy
to life again. He was a small delicate lad, though
two years older than myself; a motherless lad,
an only son—the heir to a great property. His
name was Worton; and from the time he opened
his eyes that day when I fought for him with the
sea, till the hour when I closed the lids over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>them in Ischia, he never could bear me to leave
him. And I never did leave him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Worton, who had seen the whole of the
accident, was grateful, more grateful than there
was any necessity for, and he offered to take me
and bring me up with his own boy and provide
for me, and allow my father a small annuity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If we had asked half his fortune, I think he
would have given it to us, when he heard his son
speak again. He need not have been so liberal
as he was, and I have often wished since he had
let us alone; but it seemed a fine thing to us
then, and I went back with them to Worton
Court as Master Reginald’s friend—companion—what
you will.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We led an awfully idle life. All Mr.
Worton’s time was devoted to thinking what
would best please his son; all Master Reginald’s
time was taken up trying to keep himself out of
the grave. As Burns says, ‘he met every face
with a greeting like that of Balak to Balaam:
“Come, curse me that East wind, and come,
defy me the North.”’ It was such a labour to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>him to live, that I have often wondered since
he did not wish to</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>“‘Set up his everlasting rest,</div>
      <div class='line'>And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars</div>
      <div class='line'>From his world-wearied flesh.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But he desired nothing of the kind. He enjoyed
existence as much as I have ever known any
one. He used to like lying on the sofa in the
winter time; lying on the grass in the summer.
He liked being read to, he liked to hear music;
he was fond of travelling by very slow stages,
in a very easy carriage; he enjoyed society, and
he loved me.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We loved one another,” went on Mr. Aggland,
after a pause. “‘We were so mixed as meeting
streams, for he was I, I he.’ The day came when
they tried to separate us, tried to make me
believe he would be better without me—tried to
make him believe I was no fit companion for
him; but we could not part till death took him,
and then I stood in the world alone. They had
made me what I was. Reginald had a tutor, but
we never learnt anything—never were expected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>to learn. All my life had been for eight years
spent in keeping him alive; for eight years I did
nothing but that; for eight years I read, but
never studied. I amused him, but never worked
myself. I stood between him and a woman who
wanted to become his stepmother; and at the
end of that time, at twenty-four years of age, I
was cast adrift, with a fair library of books, and
fifty pounds in my pocket. The poor fellow had
left me all his mother’s small property, four thousand
pounds; but there were such things said of
me by that cruel woman, and Reginald’s deluded
father, that I flung the legacy to them, and,
shaking the dust from my feet, left the house for
ever. Mr. Worton would have had me back. He
offered me money, he offered me any apology I
chose to ask. He offered to ‘advance my views;’
but I cursed him and his patronage too, cursed
the day he took me from my own station, and
gave me a taste for luxuries I could never
command.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘You have had the best years of my life,’ I
finished; ‘you have unfitted me for work; you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>have made me as useless as if I had been born a
gentleman. You let them try to turn your son’s
heart against me; and when they failed in that,
you allow them to saddle his legacy with such
slanders as force me, for my own credit’s sake, to
go out into the world a beggar, rather than be
beholden to the bounty of my dead friend. And
all for what? All because a woman wants to
marry you; all because you want an heir to Worton
Court—an heir that I hope, and pray, and
believe will never be born to you. For God is
just, and He will not forget Reginald, and He
will not forget me.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hard words,” said his auditor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They were too hard,” answered Mr. Aggland,—“too
hard to speak to a misguided, childish old
man. I thought about them afterwards, till I
could bear the recollection no longer, and wrote to
apologise, to retract. Madam returned the letter,
with a note, stating that ‘Mr. Worton appreciated
my present regret as highly as my former services;
and concluding want of money had procured
him the honour of my communication,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>inclosed me a cheque for a hundred pounds, the
acknowledgment of which she begged might end
the correspondence.’ I sent back the cheque, and
have since fought out my fight alone. What I
have done during the years which have come and
gone between this time and that could scarcely
interest you. There are few things I have not
tried my hand at; I have prospered in life, and
was able moreover to keep my father without letting
him take another sixpence from Mr. Worton;
but it was hard work, beginning existence, as one
may say, with soft hands—no profession, no useful
learning—at four-and-twenty. Now, sir, you know
why I do not desire patronage for my son—why I
had rather see him earning his bread by the sweat
of his brow than eating it, as I did, at a rich man’s
table. Going over my own story has made me
see clearly that which is best for him; and I
decline your offer, sir, though I thank you most
heartily for it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was an awkward silence after this. Captain
Stondon looked across at Skillanscar, and
along the defile to the broken stone bridge, ere he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>began to say, in a voice so low that it almost
seemed as though he were telling some secret
which he feared being overheard—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not been quite frank with you, Mr.
Aggland. I wish to do something for Duncan,
but I want much more earnestly to do something
for myself. Will you aid me in the matter? May
I count on your help?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it? What help do you need?” And
the two men stopped and faced each other, seeing
nothing for the moment but the shadowy future,
which was coming towards them both as a reality
and a substance, with giant strides across the
hills.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you not guess?” asked Captain Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would rather be certain,” answered Mr.
Aggland, drily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, it is this,” said Captain Stondon,
plunging desperately into his confession. “I
want to marry your niece. I love her. I will try
to make her happy; I will——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stop a moment,” interrupted Mr. Aggland,
and he sat him down on a stone by the side of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>the path, and turned his face away from his companion,
while he watched the hopes and the plans
of his later life frustrated, the last fragment of his
fancy castle levelled with the ground. If Phemie
married this man she was lost to him and his.
No matter how well Duncan got on in the years
to come, Phemie might never be wife to him;
there would be no cozy farm-house among the
hills, to which he could wend his steps when the
summer glory was lying on tree and grass and
heather; there would be no ingle nook in the
dark winter days to come, where he might be
always sure of being greeted with looks of love
and words of welcome. The doors of the modest
house he had imagined for the pair were shut
violently in his face. But for Phemie? while he
stood without in the cold, there were other doors
opened for her to pass through: she might be
rich, she might become a great lady. Had he any
right to stand between her and such a future?
Dare he condemn her to seclusion certainly, to
poverty possibly? Could he tell her to go afoot
through life, whilst there was a carriage waiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>to take her easily and pleasantly along the
highways of a world, where struggles for daily
bread and anxieties for the morrow were unknown?</p>

<p class='c011'>Should he, for any selfish feeling—for any dread
of losing her—for any personal consideration—stand
between her and the prospect her beauty
had opened out for her? Mr. Aggland thought
he would try to be disinterested both ways: he
thought he would try to forget, on the one hand,
that if Captain Stondon married Phemie he
should lose her, and he determined, on the other,
that he would not sell the girl for any benefit
likely to accrue to him or his from her change of
position. He would think of Phemie, and Phemie
alone. He would try to do his duty by her, and
listen to all Captain Stondon had to say, quietly
and dispassionately. Having made up his mind
to which prudent course, Mr. Aggland turned to
his companion, and said:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was beginning to fear this; you perhaps
think I ought to have seen it before, but I did
not. Not even a suspicion crossed my mind until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Saturday night, and I have been trying ever
since to get rid of that suspicion. I mean nothing
ungracious, sir; but I wish anybody else
rather than myself had picked you up from
there——” and Mr. Aggland flung a stone down
the path to the exact spot where Davy discovered
the traveller; “and I wish it had pleased you to
fall in love with any other girl in Cumberland
sooner than with Phemie Keller.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You need not distress yourself about the
matter,” answered the officer: “tell me to go,
and I will go. Though it would have been better
for me had you left me to die on the hill-side,
still, tell me to give up all hopes of future happiness,
all chance of domestic contentment, and
I will do it. I will pay you for my life with my
happiness, and though the bargain be a hard one,
hold to it honestly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe you would,” said Mr. Aggland, looking
with a certain admiration at the man who
made this offer. “I believe you would. I believe
you to be honest and honourable, generous and
true, and that makes it all the harder for me to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>say what I want to say. I am between two stools—I
am on the horns of a dilemma—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>‘I am a heavy stone</div>
      <div class='line'>Roll’d up a hill by a weak child: I move</div>
      <div class='line'>A little up, and tumble back again.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Let me speak first, then,” suggested Captain
Stondon, seating himself as he spoke on a piece of
rock close by Mr. Aggland. “Let me tell you I
have not run into temptation wittingly—that I
have not remained in your house, eaten your
bread, partaken of your hospitality, with any deliberate
intention of frustrating your wishes, and
taking your niece from you. Knowledge has
come upon me as it has come upon you, suddenly;
all I ask is for you to consider my proposal well
before you give me any answer. I know what
you have desired; I know you want Miss Keller
to become your son’s wife. I see you have set
your heart on this match; but I entreat you not
to prejudice her mind against me on this account.
I implore you not to influence her against me,
because you wish her to marry him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Mr. Aggland tossed back his hair,—his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>hair which was like the mane of a wild horse,—and
said, “‘Is thy servant a dog that he should do
this thing?’ Do you think I am ‘moulded of
such coarse metal’ as all that comes to? Do you
imagine I have no love for anything but myself—that,
though I have reared her as my own child—though
I do not deny that the idea of her
leaving me, of her marrying you, is ‘like the
tyrannous breathing of the north,’ which ‘shakes
all our buds from growing,’—that I cannot still
desire her happiness, and try for her sake—for
the sake of the dead and gone—to see clearly?
I see two things: I see you can give her wealth
and position; but——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what?” asked Captain Stondon, as the
farmer paused.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is little more than a child,” said Mr.
Aggland, hesitatingly, “and you are middle-aged.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A man can love in middle age as well as in
his earliest youth,” answered Captain Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“True; but can a girl love that man?” asked the
other. “I could not think of any one of Phemie’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>age except as a daughter, and I should say that
you are as old as I am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If he only knew,” thought Captain Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is too like May and December for my
taste,” Mr. Aggland went on, firmly. “She is in
the very earliest spring-time of life; she has got
her April and May—her glorious summer-tide—all
before her; and you, like myself, are travelling
on towards the frosts and snows of winter. Is it
a right thing, I ask you? I put it dispassionately—is
it right?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Love takes no account of years,” replied the
officer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the one side. I am talking of the other side.
Phemie is but little over sixteen, and you are, say
five-and-forty. Look at that, sir; thirty years—half
a lifetime—between you. Only think of
it—thirty years at the wrong end; bad enough
between thirty and sixty, but downright madness
between twenty and fifty. And she will not
be even twenty for more than three years to
come! She is too young, sir, far and away too
young.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>“The difference is on the right side,” replied
Captain Stondon. “Does not your favourite
Shakespeare advise—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>‘Let still the woman take</div>
      <div class='line'>An elder than herself?’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; but I am not aware that Shakespeare
advises a woman in any case to marry her father,”
retorted Mr. Aggland.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is older than Duncan, and you would
have had her marry him,” persisted Captain Stondon.
“You would give her to him without a
regret; you would shut her within the walls of
this mountain prison for ever, and never sigh over
such a waste of grace and beauty. You could see
her working about her husband’s house—working
like a servant—and never wish she had been born
to a different lot.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are wrong in some of your statements,”
answered Mr. Aggland; “yet she might be happy
among these hills; and, if she were happy, I do
not know that I ought to desire anything more for
her. The Queen on her throne can be but that.
If the peasant be happy, he is as prosperous a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>man as the peer; for happiness is the acme of
earthly bliss. It is the Bathmendi of the Persian
tale which we wander all over the world to find,
while it lies awaiting us in some sequestered nook
like Tordale.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaning his elbow on his knee, supporting his
chin on his hand, Mr. Aggland looked thoughtfully
and sorrowfully down the defile as he
spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>All truth contains an echo of sadness; and it is
for this reason, I suppose, because it is sad as well
as solemn, that a man never speaks it either to
his own heart or to his fellow without feeling
graver for the utterance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some thought of this kind passed through
Captain Stondon’s mind even while he answered—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your argument will bear turning. A peer
may be as happy as a peasant; the wife of a rich
man as happy as the wife of a poor. If I have
found my Bathmendi in Tordale, there is surely
no reason why I should not carry it back with me
to Marshlands. God knows I have waited long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and travelled far. Do not send me out again into
the world—desolate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And growing eloquent in the very extremity of
his fear that he should be cast forth from this
earthly heaven into which he had strayed all unwittingly,
Captain Stondon told the story of his
life—of his cold, cheerless, lonely life—to his
attentive auditor. He told of the years he had
lived unloved; he spoke of the romantic affection
of his boyhood—of the attachment he had cherished—of
the end which had come to it, and to
all the dreams of his youth. He told how he had
never thought to love again—never thought to
marry, or settle down, or hear the prattle of
children, or look for an heir to all the broad acres
of Marshlands. As a man he appealed to a man.
There was nothing he said with which Mr. Aggland
could not sympathise; and, as he proceeded,
the farmer began to see more and more that the
match would be a good one for Phemie; that if
she could but love him, she had every chance of
happiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>A just man and a true, a faithful man and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>forbearing; a man whose heart was as young as a
boy’s, who would be a husband, a lover, a friend,
all in one; who would feel for the girlish thing he
was taking from among the mountains to the
bustle and stir of the world; who would take
thought for her inexperience; who would stand
by her in trouble; who would be staunch till
death; who did not consider love a light thing, or
woman a toy, but who would take Phemie as a
sacred trust, for the care of which he should have
to answer before the throne of God.</p>

<p class='c011'>And further—for it would be but half-telling a
story to keep back any of the truth—Mr. Aggland
could not be blind to the fact that, in a worldly
point of view, Captain Stondon was a most excellent
<i><span lang="fr">parti</span></i>. He had thought his guest well-off,
but he had never known <em>how</em> well-off he was, till
the officer spoke at length of his position, of the
value of Marshlands, of the nature of the settlements
he could make; of the extent of the property
his son—if he had one—would inherit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see,” he said, at last, “that, putting aside
the one obstacle, it would be a wonderful match
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>for Phemie to make. Though she is well born,
she has no fortune, and a pretty face is a poor
substitute for a dowry anywhere. I know she
will never get such an offer again, and if you can
win her, wear her. Take her from us, for you can
do better for her, I fear, than we can. The children
will break their hearts to be parted from
her, but that cannot be helped.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why should they be parted?” asked Captain
Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because, though Phemie has walked with us
long,” answered Mr. Aggland, “we have come to
the cross-roads now, and her way lies different
from ours. That is, it will lie different if she elect
to go with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And, having uttered this sentence, which he
spoke mournfully, the farmer rose to go back
along the mountain path, cherishing no hope in
his mind that Phemie would refuse her wealthy
suitor, feeling a conviction that the girl would
soon be leaving Tordale—leaving the old familiar
scenes far behind her for ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he did not interfere—he did not advise;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>there were plenty of people to tell her what a
great match she might make, what a grand lady
she might become, without his opening his lips on
the subject. Gradually the neighbours began to
talk. The young surgeon from Grassenfel twitted
Phemie when he met her in the valley about
having grown proud and distant. He supposed it
was that fine gentleman lover of hers who had
made her turn up her nose at humble suitors like
himself. Then Mr. Conbyr threw out some hints
in a decorous, clerical kind of manner, which
showed that he evidently thought Miss Keller an
amazingly lucky young person; not long after
that, Duncan grew sulky, and Mrs. Aggland deferential;
and Peggy, ay, even Peggy M‘Nab, began
to sound Captain Stondon’s praises in her darling’s
ears.</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie had her senses. Phemie could not be
blind—she knew what was coming; and when at
last it did come, and she took counsel with her
uncle, the pair cried in each other’s arms, and
then decided that Phemie should think the
matter over, and give Captain Stondon an answer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>when she had thought it out quietly, and
alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sitting up in her little bed that night, with the
ghostly white draperies looking still more white
and ghostly in the moonlight, her head on Peggy’s
shoulder, her tears falling on Peggy’s bosom,
Phemie talked about Captain Stondon and his
offer till she grew sick and weary. I think if
Peggy had remained firm to the creed in which
she was answerable for having brought her nursling
up, Phemie would scarcely have relinquished
her dream husband without a greater struggle;
but, as it was, Peggy turned traitor, and, in the
face of reality, scouted the vision she had so often
conjured up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I dare say he is very good,” finished Phemie,
“and I do like him very well; but he is not in
the least like the lord you promised should come
for me in a coach-and-four whenever I grew tall
enough to be married.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was na’ to be expectit,” answered Peggy
M‘Nab, oracularly; and who may say but that
Peggy’s observation was strictly true? Perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>its very truth made the remark all the more irritating
to Phemie, who, laying her head on her
pillow, cried herself to sleep, feeling that between
the romance of her life and the reality there was
indeed all the difference!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='c009'>RETROSPECTIVE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>During the greater part of the next day, Phemie
mended stockings as if her life depended on the
rapidity with which she worked. She would not
eat—she would not talk—she would not play with
the children—but she would stitch on hour after
hour, never lifting her eyes except to look out at
the rain, which was pelting down in torrents.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every one in the house knew as a matter of
course that Phemie was making her choice; even
the youngest child contemplated her with a vague
kind of wonder, dimly conscious that Phemie was
thinking of something in which it could have no
part or lot—something which separated her from
the remainder of the household for the time being,
which rendered it necessary for all conversation
held in her presence to be unnatural and constrained,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>and which forced Daniel Aggland, junior—the
baby above mentioned—to sit down on the
carpet and stare at Phemie for a full half-hour
without winking.</p>

<p class='c011'>There it sat, holding its shoeless foot with its
right hand, while sucking the thumb of its left—there
it sat, the child looking at the girl to whom
the woman’s question, marriage, had come to be
solved so soon, until, having exhausted its wonderment,
it began to take offence at Phemie’s unusual
silence and at last burst out into a paroxysm
of indignant screams.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Phemie laid aside her work and comforted
it. She had grown so accustomed to nursing that,
young though she was, she could hush and quiet a
child’s distress as cleverly as any matron in the
county. She had such a sweet voice, that instinctively
the baby ceased crying to listen to its tones.
She had such a beautiful face, that the little
hands unclenched naturally in order to stroke it.
She had such divine hair, that infant eyes instinctively
opened wide to watch the light flickering
and rippling over the braids.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>She had such a way of gathering a child to her,
that the tiny creature could not choose but lie
still, nestling close to her heart. Dear Phemie
Keller! pretty, vain, gay, fanciful, dreamy Phemie—thinking
of you as you walked up and down
that little sitting-room, hushing the child into
quietness, it seems to me that Captain Stondon
might well be excused for forgetting his own age
and your youth, and remembering only the
beauty which he saw, and the true, faithful
nature that he had penetration enough to know
you possessed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor baby Danny,” muttered Mrs. Aggland
<i><span lang="it">sotto voce</span></i>, as she watched the girl soothing the
child’s distress; “you won’t have her long to coo
over you and humour you at every turn; you’ll be
a poor forsaken baby soon, for mother won’t have
time to be waiting upon you as Phemie has done.”</p>

<p class='c011'>All of which Phemie heard, as Mrs. Aggland
intended she should; truth being that Mrs. Aggland
had a burning desire to know for certain
what she was thinking about.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is the most unnatural thing I ever heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>of,” said the mistress of the Hill Farm to Peggy
M‘Nab. “Instead of taking counsel with one and
another, and being uplifted at the notion of being
made a grand lady of for life, she sits like a statue
mending them old stockings, not opening her lips
to a soul, not even talking about her wedding
clothes. Anybody might think it was sentence
of death that had come instead of an offer of
marriage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Marriage is an unco’ serious thing,” answered
Peggy M‘Nab.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may say that, Peggy,” replied Mrs. Aggland;
“not that you can know much about the
matter from your own experience; but still it is
not so serious a thing as a funeral; and Phemie
sits there with as solemn a face as if she was at a
burying, sighing every now and then as though
her heart was like to burst.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe she’s no on for taking him,” suggested
Peggy; “though he’s weel enough, weel favoured
and kindly spoken, he’s no young, mistress. He’s
nearer a match for you or me, nor for such a bairn
as Phemie.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“As for that, Peggy M‘Nab,” said Mrs. Aggland,
“I will thank you to keep your distance, and not
talk of your age and mine in the same sentence,
when anybody with half an eye can see you might
be my mother twice over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would have had to begin young, then,” remarked
Peggy, parenthetically.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And with regard to Captain Stondon,” went
on Mrs. Aggland, unheeding the interruption,
“what does the few years’ difference between him
and Phemie signify? Won’t she have everything
she wants? Won’t she have money, and leisure,
and dress, and servants, and carriages and horses,
and goodness only can tell what besides? And
don’t you know those are just the things Phemie
has been hankering after all her life? Is she not
the making of a fine lady?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is bonny enough for one, at ony rate,” put
in Peggy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some may think her so. I know I think her
conceity enough for anything; and if she wants
all this—if she wishes to be made a princess
just at once, why need she look so miserable now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>it is all put in her way—by the act of Providence,
as one may say? Does she think she will ever get
such a chance again? Does she think it snows,
and hails, and rains husbands on the hills? Does
she think a poor country girl can pick and choose
like some great heiress? Does she imagine all
the lords and dukes in the country are coming
down to Cumberland to make her a peeress out of
hand? If she thinks that, Peggy M‘Nab, she is
mistaken, and so I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Nobody knew better than Peggy that Phemie
was mistaken. Nobody knew better than the old
Scotch woman that there is a deal of difference between
a fairy tale and everyday life; between the
lover of a winter evening’s story and the suitor
who, in the broad daylight, comes in his proper
flesh and blood to ask for the fair maiden’s hand.
Since the suitor had come across the hills—since
such astonishing good fortune had fallen to
Phemie’s lot as to secure a real live gentleman for
her lover—Peggy M‘Nab had seen light. It was
very well to keep back the farmers’ sons, and the
young tradesmen who sometimes came from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>neighbouring towns to see their parents at Tordale;
but to reject Captain Stondon—to repulse this
middle-aged Robin Gray, when there was not a
Jamie at all in the question, Peggy saw would be
midsummer madness. Was not he, as she often
said, a “braw man,” tall and erect, and gentleman-looking,
and of gentle bluid into the bargain?
Had not he given her, Peggy, as much money in
one handful as she earned for wages in the course
of a year? Was not he quiet spoken? not a ranting,
shouting devil like the young surgeon from
Grassenfel, who alternately cursed Peggy for a fool,
and slapped her on the back, saying she was a great
old girl for all that. He did not drink spirits raw,
like Mr. Fagg. He did not come into the house
like a company of dragoons. You never heard
him say a wry word about his food; whatever was
set before him he eat, let it be loaf-bread or oatmeal,
haggis or a joint. Was it not better to be
an old man’s darling than a young man’s slave?
Spite of the fairy tales, and the lord’s son, and the
carriage and four, was not Captain Stondon’s offer
better than any reality Peggy had ever thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>likely to come in her nurseling’s way? Vague
visions are one thing—tangible success is another;
and there is no use in denying that the tangible
success which had come to Phemie Keller astonished
every person who knew that young lady,
except, indeed, the young lady herself, who, having
pacified the child at last, laid it down in its
mother’s lap, and then gathering up her work,
went off to her own room, where, having locked
her door, she drew a chair up to the window, and
sat down to look out upon the valley of Tordale,
whilst she thought of her own present—of her own
future.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was but a young thing after all, dear reader,
to be thinking about the whole of her life to come—but
a young, ignorant girl, to be brought in a
moment face to face, with that which was to determine
the weal or the woe of every future hour;
and as she gazed down the valley her tears fell
faster than the driving rain, and she leaned her
head against the window-frame and cried as though
her heart were breaking, at the choice she was
called upon to make so suddenly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>It is not much to read about this man’s mistake,
about that woman’s error; the book is closed, the
tale forgotten, and the reader goes on his own
path contentedly. Even when soul talking to soul
some one tells his neighbour where and how he
lost himself—how he went wrong—where he dug
deep graves—where he laid down his heart in the
coffin beside some frail human body, the listener,
sympathizing though he may be, is apt to overlook
what loss all this wrong and suffering
involved.</p>

<p class='c011'>Do you know when he has finished what it all
meant? As he turns away, do you understand
what he has been talking about? It was his life,
man; and he had but one. But one, good God!
and that is what none of these happy, prosperous
people can be made to comprehend. He has
spoiled his horn; he has not made his spoon.
Other people have lives to live out and make the
most of, but he has marred his: it may not signify
much to you, my friend, but it signifies everything
to him, because he cannot go back and begin <i><span lang="la">de
novo</span></i>; it has been all loss, and in this world there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>may never come a profit to compensate for that
which he has left behind.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some idea of this kind, very vague and very
shadowy, passed through Phemie’s mind as she sat
at the window looking through blinding tears at
the familiar landscape, at the mountains that had
been her friends for years. It might not be very
much she was considering; but it was her all,
nevertheless. Her little investment in the world’s
great lottery might be a mere bagatelle; but it
was the whole of her capital, notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was her life; it was what I have been trying
to talk about; it was everything she possessed of
value on earth, that she sat thinking of as the
evening darkness gathered down upon Tordale
church; upon the wet graves where the dead,
who had lived out their lives before she was born,
were sleeping quietly; upon the waterfall; upon
the trees; upon the distant valley; upon the
parsonage house, in the dining-room whereof Captain
Stondon was standing at that very moment,
thinking, in the flickering firelight, of her.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the seed-time is to the harvest; as the acorn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>is to the oak; as the blossom is to the fruit, so
was this vague thought to Phemie Keller, in comparison
to what the same thought grew to, clear
and tangible, in the after years, which were then
all before her. It was instinct; it was an uncertain
glimmering of an eternal truth. With the
same shadowy indistinctness—with the same unreasoning
terror as that of a child coming in
contact for the first time with death—did Phemie
Keller look out for the first time from her little
bed-chamber on life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hitherto, though I have spoken of the promise
of her beauty, I have said little of herself, and
less of the kind of existence hers had been from
childhood, until Captain Stondon met her in
Tordale church. She is thinking of her past as
she sits in the gathering darkness; thinking as
she leans her head against the window-frame, and
listens to the wind howling among the mountains,
and the rain beating over the beautiful valley
below—at one and the same moment of when
she will be a woman, and of when she was a
child. She is wondering, if she leaves Tordale,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>with what eyes she will look upon it again; what
she will have to pass through, ere, in years to
come, she returns to look upon it once more; and
as she wonders, her memory casts back to the
days that are gone, and she is a child in the old
manse by the sea-shore, listening to the roar of
the ever-restless ocean, lying in her bed with
the waves singing her lullaby, wandering on the
beach and building up palaces on the sand—palaces
ornamented with shells, and set out with
sea-weed that the next flood-tide destroyed!</p>

<p class='c011'>What more did she see? what more did memory
give back to her, as the waves cast up drift on the
shore? Out of the past there came again to her
the self she had been, the child she could never
be more.</p>

<p class='c011'>A child with a clear white skin, through which
the veins appeared blue and distinct—a delicate
child with a faint colour in her cheeks, with
golden hair, who was mostly dressed in white,
who had dainty muslin frocks, who had soft lace,
edging her short sleeves, who was her grandfather’s
pet, who was the life and soul of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>manse; with her old-fashioned talk; with her
loving, clinging, twining, cheery, tender ways. A
child who, being always with grown-up people,
learned to think long before her proper time—a
child who had never lain down to sleep when a
storm was raging without praying God to bring
those who were on sea, safe to land—a young
thing who had seen women wringing their hands
and mourning for the dead—who having lost both
father and mother herself could understand the
meaning of the word orphan, and cry with the
fatherless children as they talked about the
parents who might never again come home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Right and wrong! She had learnt what both
words signified in early days in that old manse by
the sea-shore. From the time she could toddle,
she had been wont to shake her head gravely at
temptation, and to draw back her fingers from
desired objects, lisping to herself, “Musn’t;
granpa’s father in heaven wouldn’t be pleased,”
and then she would mount on a chair, and, sitting
cross-legged upon it, argue out the rest of the
question to her own satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>There never was a better child than Phemie!
Save for the way she cried when the wind was
high, and the sea rough; save for the trick she
had of stripping herself half naked in order to
clothe any beggar brat who might happen to be
complaining of the cold; save for huffy fits she
took when her grandfather was too busy to notice
her; save for the unaccountable and unanswerable
questions she was in the habit of propounding
suddenly—Phemie—little Phemie, I mean, had
not a fault.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most terrible battle she and the household
at the manse ever fought was over the body of a
dead kitten, which she kept from decent burial
for a whole day, and which was at length taken
from her arms only when she had cried herself to
sleep over the loss of her pet. To grandfather
and servants, to the fishermen and their wives,
to the shepherds on the moors, to the children by
the roadside, Phemie Keller—little soft-hearted
Phemie—was an object of the tenderest interest
and affection.</p>

<p class='c011'>The courtship of her father and mother was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>talked of by the side of many a winter fire. The
young things—boy and girl—who had fallen in
love at first sight, who had met secretly by the
sea-shore, who had been seen by the shepherds
walking hand in hand together among the heather,
who had wanted the old minister to marry
them, and who had bound themselves together as
man and wife before a couple of witnesses when
he refused to let them wed unless the consent of
the lover’s family were first obtained, who had
gone away out into the world together—all the
story was repeated over and over whenever
Phemie’s name was mentioned in the lonely cottages
scattered here and there through the thinly-peopled
district.</p>

<p class='c011'>The love-story with its sorrowful end; the
love-story, finis to which was written on a moss-covered
headstone in the quiet kirkyard close by!
They had known her a girl, and she came back to
them a widow—came back, “wi’ her wee bit
bairn, Phemie, to dee.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Was it not natural that a certain romance
should be associated with Phemie in the minds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>of those who could remember her parents so
well? Was it to be wondered at, if they made,
perhaps, too much of the child; if they speculated
as to her future lot, foolishly?</p>

<p class='c011'>Anyhow, Phemie was loved, and petted; and
never a princess ruled more absolutely over her
subjects, than did the young child rule over
the household at the manse. It was always who
could please Phemie most, who could make her
look prettiest, who could get sitting by her till
she went to sleep, who could make time to take
the child on her lap, and tell her the stories she
liked best to hear.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the old tales of fairies and brownies, of
second sight, of witches and warlocks, were familiar
to Phemie as her A B C. Old ballads were
recited to her; old songs were sung to her, till
her head was as full of romantic narrative as it
could hold.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was not a blast that blew over the hills
but touched an answering note in the child’s
heart. The poetry lying there always uttered
some responsive tone in answer to the elements—sunshine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>and shower, storm and calm, the wind
whistling across the moors or sobbing through
the fir-trees, the snow covering the earth, or the
spring flowers decking the fields—all these things
had a double meaning for Phemie; like a face
reflected from glass to glass, every object in
nature was projected into the child’s heart from
the heart of some one else who had basked in the
summer glory, and braved the winter tempest
before she was thought of.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then came Death to the manse once more;
and this time he took the old minister from
among his people to the kirkyard, within sound
of the mourning and murmuring sea. Thoughtful
hearts tried to keep Phemie from seeing him in
his coffin, but Phemie’s thoughtfulness exceeded
theirs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her love made her cunning; and then the
episode of the kitten was repeated with the grief
intensified, with the despair more terrible.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was taken away to a friend’s house, and
kept there till the funeral was over. All the day
they watched her; but at night, in the dead of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the winter time, she seized her opportunity and
tracked her way across the moors to the manse,
sobbing through the darkness as she toiled
along.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the manse they watched her again, and
again she eluded their vigilance, and stole out
to the lonely kirkyard, where she was found
tearing up the wet mould with her little
hands; scratching at the newly-made grave like
a dog.</p>

<p class='c011'>After that, grievous sickness—sickness almost
unto death, and then removal by slow stages to
the house of the only living relative willing to
receive her—Mrs. Aggland, her mother’s sister.
The Agglands had children of their own; but
yet at the Hill Farm it was the old story enacted
once again by fresh performers. Her aunt could
not be too kind to her. Mr. Aggland might
punish his own daughter, but he never dreamt
of saying a cross word to Phemie Keller. She
was privileged: by reason of her desolateness, by
reason of her story, by reason of her sensitive
heart, that reproof and harshness would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>broken, Phemie had <i><span lang="fr">carte blanche</span></i> to do as she
liked, and if she did not grow up indolent and
selfish, it was simply because there are some
natures that cannot be made indolent or selfish
by kindness and indulgence.</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet it may fairly be questioned whether
Phemie would ever have developed into a useful
character, but for the death of her aunt. Whilst
Mrs. Aggland lived the girl had always some one to
think for her; see to her; love her. When once
her aunt died, out of very gratitude, for very pity,
Phemie was forced to think for others; see to
others; and give love, and care, and affection,
back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was sic a sair sicht to see the puir maister
frettin’ after his wife,” as Peggy M‘Nab asserted,
that by common consent Peggy M‘Nab and Phemie
Keller joined together to make him feel his loss
in the trifles of everyday life as little as might
be. Phemie was still a child, a mere child, but
yet she could do something for the widower; she
could nurse the baby and keep its cries from
troubling its father; she could help Peggy in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>thousand little ways; she could amuse the little
ones by repeating to them the stories she had
heard told in broad Scotch, where the Scottish
moors stretched away lone and desolate towards
the north; she could read to him; she could
work for him; she could stand at the door looking
for his return; she could talk to him in the
twilight; and she could make the sight of her
bright pretty face as welcome to the solitary man
as the flowers in May.</p>

<p class='c011'>After his second marriage, Phemie proved more
useful still. As she grew older, she grew not
merely cleverer, but wiser—wise to hold her
tongue, wise to keep unpleasantness in the background,
wise to do the work she had to do with
a cheerful countenance and a brave heart, wise
towards everybody but herself, for she dreamed
dreams and built castles all the day long.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aided and abetted therein by Peggy M‘Nab,
who was never weary of telling Phemie about her
father, about the great family he belonged to,
about the grand folks, somewhere or other, with
whom Phemie could claim kith and kin.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>If Mrs. Aggland were cross, if Phemie wearied
over her making and mending, if the girl ever
took to fretting about the days departed, straight
away Peggy told her nursling “to whisht.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Canna ye quet yer greetin’—canna ye tak
patience for a bit? Dinna ye ken that if ye
wunna thraw that bonnie face o’ yours, some braw
laird will come ben when ye hae leest thocht o’
him, and mak ye a gentle for life? He’ll come
in the gloamin’ over the hills speerin’ for ane
Phemie Keller, and he’ll tak ye awa’, my bairn—he’ll
tak ye frae thrawn words and cross looks,
and frae yer auld daft nurse wha canna bear to
see ye forfoughten.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And then Phemie would declare she was not
fretting, and that no laird, not even the Duke
of Argyll himself, should take her from Peggy
M‘Nab.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wherever I go, ye shall go,” Phemie was
wont to declare; “and I’d like to take Duncan,
and Helen, and the rest of uncle’s children, and
we could leave Mrs. Aggland her children, and
make him come with us. Where should we go,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Peggy, and how should we go? Tell me all about
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus exhorted, Peggy would conjure up quite
a royal procession for Phemie’s edification.</p>

<p class='c011'>With her darling’s lovely head resting in her
lap, with the girl’s soft white fingers stroking her
hard brown hands, Peggy was wont to talk of a
hero so handsome and good and clever as to
border on the impossible; of estates and houses
that might have made an auctioneer’s fortune;
of furniture that sounded like an inventory taken
of the domestic goods and chattels of some establishment
in fairyland; of horses that could never
have been foaled on earth, so great was their
speed, so extraordinary their beauty; the crowning
gem of the whole programme being the carriage,
which, I am afraid, Peggy would have
described as precisely similar to the state chariot
of the Lord Mayor of London, had she ever
been so blest as to behold that functionary’s
progress on the 9th of November through the
City streets.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was for long a vexed question between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Phemie and her nurse, whether the Kellers, or a
distracted lover were to come for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peggy held to the Kellers, but Phemie preferred
the lover, who was to right her wrongs, to
take her from the cinders, and dance with her at
the ball, and get her the property of her ancestors,
and live happily with her for ever after.
She did not want to owe anything to her father’s
family. She preferred the idea of some dark-haired,
dark-eyed nobleman coming to the Hill
Farm like a flash of lightning, and rescuing her
from stocking-mending and cast-off clothes, after
the fashion of a hero of romance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes in her fancy she would be proud
and distant, sometimes indifferent, sometimes
cruel and unkind; but however she began the
story, it had never but one end, and that end was
not suicide and distraction, but a grand wedding,
and joy, and confidence, and love all the days of
their lives.</p>

<p class='c011'>They would build a castle on the site of the
Hill Farmhouse, and come and spend some portion
of every summer at Tordale. Mr. Conbyr
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>should have his organ, and she would bestow such
magnificent presents on the wives of the farmers
she had known! She would even give Mrs.
Aggland a satin dress, and a brooch, and a bonnet,
and everybody should be happy, and all
should go joyous as a marriage bell.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for the nobleman, he was to be something
between Fergus M‘Ivor, the lover of the poor
Bride of Lammermoor, and Percy, as described in
Otterbourne. Whichever of these desirable models
he most resembled, there was yet one thing in
which he never varied—his devoted affection for
herself. Phemie experienced no pangs of jealousy:
she had no mental misgivings about a previous
attachment, about any former lady love. It
was to be first love with him as well as with her;
it was to be first love and last love with both.
Heaven help her! though these dreams may
sound worldly and calculating, they were nevertheless
pure and innocent, and it was the shock
of coming down from the contemplation of such
a lover and such a fortune, to the flat level of
accepting or rejecting a middle-aged and unromantic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>suitor that proved too much for Phemie’s
equanimity, and made her—sitting by the window
looking down over Tordale valley—so sad and
thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the touch of reality had done two things:
it had wakened her at once from a land of pleasant
visions, to the certainties of existence; it
showed her she had been asleep and dreaming;
it proved to her she must wake and bestir
herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>She could not go on after this, picturing to herself
the advent of an ideal lover. Like one
arising from a long sweet slumber, she looked
out over the plains of life, and saw her actual
position for the first time.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was born—not to be run after like a damsel
of romance, but to darn stockings, and to be
considered an amazingly fortunate girl if a rich
prosaic man fell in love with and married her.
She had overrated her goods; she had been like a
man with a clever invention, who never thinks of
making hundreds out of it, but always millions,
until some one offers him, say a thousand pounds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>with which all his friends consider he ought to
believe himself overpaid.</p>

<p class='c011'>So long as her little possessions were kept out
of the market she placed a price on them far and
away above their actual value; but now, when she
saw the precise sum at which she was rated by
other people, her spirits sank to zero.</p>

<p class='c011'>If it were so wonderful a thing for this common-place
stranger to ask her to marry him, what
chance was there of the lord coming across the
hills to woo? Was it likely she should ever meet
Lord Ronald Clanronald by Strammer Tarn?
And if she did meet him, was it at all probable
he would take her back with him to his home?
Lizzie Lindsay had skirts of green satin, but
Phemie Keller had only three dresses in the
world, and none of them much to boast of!</p>

<p class='c011'>Further, it was evident her uncle had laid her
out to marry Duncan. He had mentioned it, and
she had told him that might never be. Having
told him so, what was she to do—stay on mending
old clothes and dreaming her dreams—dreams
that might never seem realities again—or go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>away and become a lady, as every one told her
she might by speaking only one word?</p>

<p class='c011'>Suppose, after all this to-do, after all this
respect, after all this disturbance, she subsided
again into the Phemie of six months previously,
should she be able to lead the old life again
patiently? Could she endure Mrs. Aggland’s
scolding, and the incessant work, work, slave,
slave, drive, drive, after this chance of freedom?
Suppose poverty came again: she had seen bad
seasons at the Hill Farm, and felt the nipping of
scarcity like the rest, and these bad seasons might
return, and then, instead of being able to help,
she would only prove an incumbrance.</p>

<p class='c011'>If she accepted Captain Stondon, her hero
would have to be turned with his face to the
wall; but if she did not accept him, why, then,
still the hero might never come, after all.</p>

<p class='c011'>What should she do? “Oh, what shall I do?”
sobbed Phemie, by way of a climax to her reverie;
and, as if in answer to her question, Helen tapped
at her cousin’s door, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Captain Stondon is in the parlour, Phemie,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>and father says, will you come down and see
him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ I hev brought ye up a candle, my bairn,”
added Peggy M‘Nab; “redd up yer hair, and
wash the tears aff yer face, for he’ll no be
pleased to see ye looking like a ghaist.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='c009'>YES OR NO.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>The grief must have been terrible, the anxiety
intense, that could have made Phemie Keller
indifferent to her personal appearance; and, accordingly,
in spite of all her sorrow and indecision,
the young lady took Peggy’s advice kindly,
and—followed it. She bathed her face, and then
removed the traces of tears by breathing on her
handkerchief and holding it to her eyes; she unfastened
her hair, and let it fall down in thick
luxuriant waves, which she combed and brushed
caressingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was very proud of her hair; her own
beauty was a great pleasure to this mountain-reared
maiden. Perhaps she would have been a
more perfect character had she not taken such
delight in her own loveliness; but then she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>would not have been Phemie Keller. She would
not have been the girl who, full of innocent
vanity, stood before her little glass, arranging
her plaits and braids in the most becoming
manner she could devise.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have read a good many books, but I never
recollect meeting in one of them with an account
of a heroine who made herself look ugly
in order to let down a rejected lover easily, nor
among my own acquaintance have I ever known
a woman forget, when discarding a suitor, to put
on her best looks for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c011'>It may be cruel, but is it not natural? Would
you have Lesbia leave off her padding and stays,
and her robe of gold, so that she might send
the poor wretch away disenchanted? Would
you have Nora Creina bind up her dishevelled
locks, which are no doubt amazingly becoming
to her, though they do not suit Lesbia, and put
on a stiff robe of state, instead of the picturesque
costume which floats as wild as mountain
breezes, when she trips across the lea to say No,
sir, no? Would you have Hebe push back her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>hair from her charming face, and make herself
look a fright? Would you have Miss, with the
fine forehead and Roman nose, wear lackadaisical
curls over her temples? Would you have Drusilla
uncover her scraggy shoulders, or Lavinia
veil her snow-white neck? Can you expect the
dear creatures to send the man away, wondering
at his own unutterable want of taste? Is it not
most natural that they should wish him to depart
in a frame of mind bordering on insanity,
possessed by seven fierce devils of loveliness,
who make his last state worse by far than his
first.</p>

<p class='c011'>And finally, although the success she had
achieved might not be that precise kind of success
which Phemie’s little heart desired to compass,
was it not natural that, having gained a certain
worldly triumph, auburn hair and dark-blue eyes
should want to look their best over the matter?</p>

<p class='c011'>For all of which reasons, and more especially
because the girl’s vanity was as genuine as her
grief, Phemie Keller brushed and smoothed and
braided her hair as daintily as though she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>been going down stairs to meet the hero of her
dreams.</p>

<p class='c011'>All women cannot go to the queen’s drawing-room,
though they may all wish to do so; but,
spite of that, they put on their best dresses, and
adopt the newest style of head decoration, when
invited to a select tea-party at the squire’s just
outside the village.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even for Mr. Fagg’s benefit, even to gladden
Mr. Conbyr’s failing sight, Phemie would have
made the best of herself, and as it was—so it was—this
innocent, unsophisticated beauty took as
much pains in arraying herself for the campaign
as though she had been born and bred amongst
those ancient ladies who wore tires on their heads
and pillows to their arms, and went mincingly,
making a tinkling as they went.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the whole, the result was satisfactory. At
sweet sixteen, tears are not altogether unbecoming.
Rain, in the summer-time, produces a different
effect on the landscape to rain in the winter;
and, in like manner, it is one thing when tears wet
the sweet buds of youth, and hang heavy on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>roses of girlhood; and quite another when they
roll heavily down the worn cheeks of middle age,
and mingle with the snows of later life.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the sweeter did Phemie Keller look for the
shower so lately fallen. There was a certain languor
about her eyes, a certain pallor in her cheeks,
which made her beauty irresistible; and as she
turned to leave the room, the girl felt perfectly
satisfied with her own appearance, and equally
certain that Captain Stondon would be satisfied
with it too.</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet, spite of this conviction, there was a
sick, faint feeling about Phemie’s heart while she
went slowly along the passage to decide her fate.
How fearfully prosaic! how horribly matter-of-fact!
how terribly real seemed this question
which she was called upon to decide!
There was no haze of love—there was no wild
attachment—no passionate hero worship. She
had never listened for his step with hand laid on
heart to still its throbbings; his voice had never
sent the blood rushing to cheek and brow; she
had never thought of him through the day, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>dreamed of him by night; she had never walked
with him hand in hand among the flowers of that
enchanted garden which is the only Eden man
ever now enters upon earth; the whispers of love
were not in her ear, urging her footsteps on. It
was a hard, cold bargain, and though Phemie did
not, could not reason all this out for herself, as I
have done for you, reader, still she instinctively
hung back, and delayed the evil moment as long
as possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going down now, uncle,” she said, opening
the door of Mr. Aggland’s private sanctum, a
room filled with books, ornamented with fire-arms,
littered with fishing-tackle, into which none of the
household were privileged to enter excepting
Phemie herself. “I am going down now,” and
she stood in the doorway, looking as if she never
wished to go down, but wanted to stay there for
ever; while Mr. Aggland, who was busy among the
pipes of the organ referred to on one occasion by
Mr. Conbyr, lifted his head, and bade her come in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not tell you to do anything, Phemie,” he
said; “remember that,” and he laid his hand on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>her shoulder while he spoke. “So far as I see,
you need not even make up your own mind just at
present. Do not be in a hurry to say either yea
or nay. ‘Hasty marriage seldom proveth well,’
Shakespeare says, as you know, and further—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What is wedlock forced, but a hell,</div>
      <div class='line'>An age of discord and perpetual strife?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>For which reason, do not let anyone over-persuade
you in this matter.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘For marriage is a matter of more worth</div>
      <div class='line'>Than to be dealt in by attorneyship.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“I know as much about my mind now as I shall
ever know,” answered Phemie. “I have been
thinking, thinking all day, till I am sick of thinking.
Advise me, uncle,” she added, with sudden
vehemence; “tell me what I ought to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Seneca says—” began Mr. Aggland.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! never mind what Seneca says,” interrupted
Phemie; “I want to hear what you say.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, my opinion is exactly his,” persisted
her uncle; “that no man should presume
to give advice to others who has not first given
good counsel to himself.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“You are playing with me,” she said, pettishly.
“I want advice, and you give me old saws instead:
I want help, and you will not hold out a finger
towards me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I cannot,” he answered. “You are
coming for advice to a man who, never having
followed any rule of reason in his own life, is incompetent
to show the wisest course to another.
I have been led by impulse for so long that I believe
I have forgotten there is such a thing as
prudence. All my life long I have lacked ‘good
sense;’</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>‘Which only is the gift of heaven;</div>
      <div class='line'>And though no science, fairly worth the seven.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was but the other day I was reading what
William Finlay wrote about himself, and I thought
then that the picture might have been drawn from
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Mr. Aggland hummed—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘While others have been busy bustling</div>
      <div class='line in2'>After wealth and fame,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wisely adding house to house,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And Baillie to their name;</div>
      <div class='line'>I, like a thoughtless prodigal,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Have wasted precious time,</div>
      <div class='line'>And followed lying vanities,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To string them up in rhyme.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“Uncle, if you asked me for anything, I would
give it to you,” said Phemie, reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so would I give you anything but advice,”
he answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anything except what I want,” she said—“anything
but that;” and at the words, Mr.
Aggland rose up, startled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Phemie, child,” he exclaimed, “do you know
what it is you are asking from me? do you think
what it is you want me to decide? It is your
future; it is the whole of that which I once
owned, but which is now behind me for ever; and
I have made such a wretched thing of life, that I
cannot tell you what to do. I am no judge, my
dear; I am no judge.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I have nobody else,” she said, piteously,
“and I cannot keep him waiting all night, and I
do not know what to say, and—and my heart is
breaking.” At which point, Phemie’s composure
gave way, and she covered her face with her hands
and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Damn marriage!” was Mr. Aggland’s remark,
and he uttered it in all sincerity. “I wish we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>were in heaven, Phemie, where there is neither
marrying nor giving in marriage; where there are
no bad crops, and no anxieties concerning the
future. I cannot advise you whether or no to take
Captain Stondon’s offer; but I do advise you to
hear what he has got to say about the matter. He
is a good man, and a true:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>‘Nature might stand up</div>
      <div class='line'>And say to all the world, this was a man.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>You may find some one whom you could love
better, Phemie, but you would never find anybody
better. And, because I believe this, I bid you go
and listen to him first, and afterwards, if you like,
we will talk together.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And with this safe counsel, having dismissed his
niece, Mr. Aggland turned him to his work again,
muttering Otway’s opinion, “‘The worst thing an
old man can be is a lover.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not the worst thing imaginable, however,
for Captain Stondon; it was well for him to have
an object given to his objectless life; well for him
to have some one to think of beside himself; well
for him to have at last a definite hope in existence:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>and sitting all alone by the fire, the officer was
dreaming some pleasant dreams, and thinking himself
far from unfortunate, when Phemie turned the
handle of the door and entered shyly.</p>

<p class='c011'>But as she did so—as she came slowly out of
the darkness into the light, something like a
shadow seemed to come out of the darkness more
swiftly than she and stand between them. It was
not a doubt, and yet Captain Stondon felt himself
remain irresolute for a moment; it was not
fear, and yet he had experienced the same sensation
before entering a battle from which he
had been afterwards carried wounded: it was a
cloud thrown for a moment over a landscape,
fair to see, lovely to contemplate; it was one of
those intangible messengers of evil who, fleet of
foot, rush through our hearts in the midst of our
joy, bidding us prepare for the sorrows that are
following more slowly after into our lives.</p>

<p class='c011'>It just came between them for a moment and
departed, and next instant Captain Stondon was
holding the girl’s hands in his, and praying her
forgiveness for his over-haste. In one sentence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>he told her, he had not been able to rest at the
vicarage; that he could not sit patiently waiting
to hear his fate: in the next, he begged her to
believe he was in no hurry; that he would not
hasten her decision; that whenever she chose to
give him an answer, would be the time he should
like best to hear it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All this day,” he went on, “I have been thinking
of you. I have been longing to be at the Hill
Farm once more. I have been wishing for the
sound of your voice. I know I ought not to have
come here this evening; but I could not live
without seeing you. Do not say anything to me
if you would rather not. Send me away again
now, and I will go through the darkness and
the rain, content to have looked in your face once
more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was needful for him to do all the talking, for
Phemie never opened her lips. She never helped
him in the least, but stood with one hand resting
on the stone chimney-piece, looking intently into
the fire. If she had been born deaf and dumb,
she could not have made less sign, and yet still all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>the time she was struggling to find words to tell
him what was passing through her heart; she
was trying to discover what she was feeling, so
that she might show him honestly all that was in
her mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>He might not be a hero, but he loved her; he
might not have black hair and piercing eyes, but
he was not beyond the pale of humanity on that
account. All the strength of feeling—all the
power of affection he had never, since his earliest
youth, lavished on any human being, he was now
wasting upon her, as the sea lays its treasures
upon some bare and thankless strand: and even
as the waves of that same sea, meeting some tiny
stream, force back the waters of the rivulet and
prevent it mingling with the ocean, so, the very
force and vehemence of this man’s passion
stopped Phemie’s utterance and made her shrink
back into herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>She felt as one standing out unsheltered in a
hurricane—she felt powerless to speak—to lift up
her voice and protest against marrying him solely
because he wished to marry her. She felt what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>many an older woman has felt—that she had got
into a mess, out of which it was impossible to
extricate herself. Through no wish—through no
striving—through no desire of her own—this man
had fallen in love with her, and she would never
have the courage to bid him go: she could do
nothing but what she did do—lift her lovely,
pleading eyes to his and burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he knew—then the shadow fell between
them again—then he paused before he took the
girl gently to him and soothed her grief, and
calmed her agitation as though he had been her
father. He had deceived himself; he had
thought this young thing could love him; he
had thought, because he was still able to feel
affection, that the power of winning the heart
of a creature in her teens was left also. He
had remembered his lands and his houses, his
gold and his silver; but he had forgotten what
mere gewgaws these things seem in the eyes of a
girl unless she has some one dearer to her than
aught else on earth—to hold and to spend with
her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>He had deceived himself, and he awakened to
the knowledge with a pang, and then straight
away he fell to deceiving himself again, and
thought that if once he could get her to say yes—if
once he could induce her to marry him—he
would earn her love; he would purchase it
by his tenderness, by his forbearance, by his
devotion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anything rather than give her up—anything
sooner than lose auburn hair and blue eyes for
ever—any trouble—any sorrow—any pain—if
trouble, sorrow, and pain, could hinder his going
out again into the wide world without Phemie
Keller by his side.</p>

<p class='c011'>And never had Phemie seemed so charming
to him as she did at that moment; never in
her gayest mood had he loved her so much as
he did when she stood there passive, letting
him stroke her hair, and draw her hands away
from her tear-stained face, as though she had
been a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everything which strikes us as most beautiful
in girlhood adorned Phemie Keller then: innocence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>timidity, dependence, guilelessness—the man
could have knelt down and worshipped her. She
was so young, so fresh, so lovely, so different from
anything he had ever seen before, that Captain
Stondon felt his pulses grow still as he looked
at her—felt the spell of her purity and beauty
laid upon him soothingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>He could not give her up; he told her so more
calmly than he had spoken any sentence yet.
He knew that in many respects he was not the
lover to win a young girl’s fancy, but he would
prove none the worse husband for that.</p>

<p class='c011'>She should have as long a time as she liked to
think the matter over; he would not hurry her;
the winds of heaven should not breathe upon her
too roughly if she married him; they would
travel. He would take her to Paris and Rome;
they would go to Switzerland and Spain. She
should see all the places of which she had read.
He would make her uncle’s position more comfortable.</p>

<p class='c011'>Duncan should be sent to school, and Helen
also; and Helen should come and spend her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>vacations at Marshlands. As for Phemie, if his
love, if his care, if his wealth, if his devotion
could keep trouble from crossing her path, life
should to her be but as a long pleasant summer’s
day; and then Captain Stondon went on to tell
her how he had never loved but once before, and
of what a desert his life had been since.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you can make it a heaven upon earth
now, if you will,” he said; “you can make me
either the happiest or the most miserable of
mortals.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet still she never spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Am I to go away without one word?” he
said. “Will you not say anything to me before I
return to the vicarage?”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Phemie never answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Am I to take silence as consent so far?” he
went on.</p>

<p class='c011'>In answer to which question the girl remained
resolutely mute.</p>

<p class='c011'>“May I think that you are not averse to me?”
he persisted; but the sweet lips never opened,
the lovely face never was turned towards him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>“Do not send me away without even a smile,”
he said at last. “Well, well, I will not teaze
you,” and he made a feint of turning to leave the
room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then all at once Phemie found words, and
cried—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not go, Captain Stondon; I want to
speak to you. I have something to say—do not
go!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nobody will advise me,” went on the girl,
passionately: “if I was to inquire of any person
I know, what I ought to do, they would tell me
what I could tell them; that you have done me a
great honour; that it is a wonderful thing for a
gentleman like you to have asked a girl like me.
I went to my uncle, and he bade me come to
you; and I do come to you, sir. What am I
to do? oh! what am I to do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was his turn to be silent now, and he
stood looking at Phemie, at her clasped hands, at
her beseeching attitude, at her eyes which were
swimming with tears, for a minute before he
answered—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“My poor child, how can I tell you what to do?
I, to whom ‘yes’ will be life, and ‘no’ death, to
every plan and hope, and desire of my future
existence. All I can say is, do not marry me if
you think it will not be for your happiness to do
so; and, above all, do not marry me if you care
for anyone else.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He put such a constraint upon himself as he
said this, that Phemie, though she caught their
sense, could scarcely hear his words.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not know anything of the storm which
was sweeping through his heart; but she had a
vague idea that he was fighting some kind of
battle when he went on—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I love you so well that you will be safe in
making me your friend. If anyone else is fond
of you, if you are fond of any other person, tell
me, and I must try to be disinterested—try to
see my duty and do it. Have you any attachment—any
preference? Answer me frankly, dear,
for God’s sake, for it may save us both much
misery hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The pretty head drooped lower, and the flushed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>cheeks grew redder; but the sweet lips parted
for all that, and Phemie whispered—“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are certain?” he said, and he raised her
lovely face, so that he might see the story it had
to tell.</p>

<p class='c011'>This time Phemie lifted her eyes to his shyly,
yet trustingly, while she replied—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am quite sure, sir—quite.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That was a comfort, at any rate: terrible
jealousy of Mr. Fagg—grave doubts concerning
one or two young men he had met in the valley—suspicions
of some secret lover, whose very existence
was unknown to anyone but Phemie—had
all conspired together to make the officer’s life a
weariness to him during the last few minutes:
but there was no mistaking Phemie’s face and
Phemie’s manner. She had no clandestine
attachment—no attachment of any kind—not
even for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was the misery—there was the next
difficulty he had to face, but Captain Stondon did
face it for all that, and said—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am afraid that you do not care for me?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“I do not know, sir.” What an aggravating
chit it was with its uncertain answers—with its
frightened manners and averted face!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you dislike me, Phemie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was on the tip of Captain Stondon’s tongue
to say, “Then what do you do?” but he refrained,
and proceeded: “Could you learn to
love me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know;” and the officer struck
his heel impatiently against the floor at her
reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>What was the use of catechising her thus?
What is the use of asking a child who does not
know its A B C, questions about reading, writing,
and arithmetic? And was not all the alphabet
of love a terra incognita to Phemie Keller?
Like a baby, she knew fairy tales; but she was
ignorant of her letters. Practical love was a
thing of which she knew as little as chubby five-years-old
knows of Hebrew. The right master to
teach her had never crossed her path; and
though Captain Stondon was perfectly up in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>subject himself, he lacked the power to impart
information to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She might marry him—she might be fond
enough of him—she might bear him sons and
daughters; but she could never feel for the husband
she was bound to—love, such we mean
when we talk about “The dream of Life’s young
day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was natural, however, that Captain Stondon
should blind himself to this fact—natural that,
loving her so much, he should forget everything
except that she was free—that it was possible for
him to gain her—that he might hope to see her
mistress of Marshlands yet.</p>

<p class='c011'>He might win this young thing for his wife;
and as he thought of this—thought it was only
her youth which made her answers vague—her
inexperience which caused her uncertainty—his
impatience vanished, and sweet visions arose of
an angel walking side by side with him upon the
earth. He saw her flitting from room to room in
the great house that had always hitherto seemed
to him so deserted; on the lawn, in the gardens,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>he beheld blue eyes and auburn hair—pleasant
pictures of home-life—home-life, such as he had
often read about in books, were before his eyes;
that which he had dreamed of so many, many
years before was all coming true at last. She did
not dislike him: for the rest—“She did not
know.” He would be satisfied with that for the
present; and instead of pressing the unsatisfactory
part of the subject, he would talk to Phemie
about what she could understand, viz., her position
as Mrs. Stondon, in comparison to her position
as Miss Keller.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wherein Captain Stondon was wise. Phemie
possessed as much common sense as her cousins.
Setting the lord out of the question, and putting
the Kellers along with the lord, she knew exactly
how she was situated to a T; and if the officer
did put the actual state of matters in plain English
before her, Phemie had quite sufficient knowledge
to understand that all he said contained neither
more nor less than the truth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Aggland was not rich. If he died—and
Phemie had seen enough of death to convince her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>disease might visit the Hill Farm any day—the
girl would have no home, no friends, no money.
Or if sickness came—sickness and bad seasons—how
were the family to be supported?</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, if all went well, did she think she could
be content to spend all her life in Cumberland?
Would she not like to go abroad, to mix in society,
to have plenty of money with which to help her
relations, and to repay some portion of what had
been done for her?</p>

<p class='c011'>As a man of the world, Captain Stondon could
not but know that the match would be a capital
one for Phemie; and though he would have given
all he possessed ten times over cheerfully to get
her for his own, he still placed his social advantages
in their best light before her.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Phemie listened, and Phemie thought, and
the longer she listened and the more she thought,
the stronger grew the idea that she should marry
this man—that she would be somehow throwing
away her best chance if she refused to take
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not like saying Yes; and yet she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>afraid the day might come when she would rue
saying No. He was very good—he was very
patient—he was very kind—he was very generous—why
should she not be happy?</p>

<p class='c011'>If an infant be crying its eyes out, a skilful
nurse has but to dangle a bunch of beads before
it, and straightway the tears are dried, the sobs
cease, and with a crow of delight feeble little
hands are stretched out to seize the glittering
prize.</p>

<p class='c011'>Somewhat after the same fashion, Phemie
Keller had been crying for that which she could
not get; and now, partly because she was weary
of weeping, and greatly because the world’s
vanities looked tempting as Captain Stondon
presented them for her contemplation, she gradually
forgot to shed any more tears, and began to
listen with interest to what he was saying.</p>

<p class='c011'>He told her about Marshlands—about its fine
timber, about its old-fashioned rooms, its endless
corridors, its lovely gardens.</p>

<p class='c011'>Carriages, horses, visitors, servants—all these
things, which are doubtless as valueless to you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>my reader, as the string of beads are to the adult,
looked very tempting to Phemie Keller.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had not been used to such vanities, and
people who have not known luxuries are apt to
overrate the happiness of their possession. By
degrees she began to ask questions, and to listen
with interest to his answers; almost imperceptibly
she came to see that, though Captain Stondon
might not be a lord, he was a grand personage—a
wealthy gentleman for all that. He was doing
her an honour, and a man has travelled a long
way towards success when he makes a woman feel
this.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He could get many a great lady to marry
him,” thought Phemie, and she felt grateful to him
for choosing her. He would give her money to
buy toys for the children—a microscope or a telescope
for her uncle, and a gown for Peggy M‘Nab.</p>

<p class='c011'>She would have to darn no more stockings, but
he would very probably let her get as much
Berlin wool and canvas as would enable her to
work a sofa-pillow like one there was down at the
Vicarage. She should go to London, and perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>see the Queen. Altogether, she did not feel so
very miserable after he had been talking to her
for half-an-hour, and though she was still resolute
not to say Yes in a hurry, she promised to speak
to her uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course Captain Stondon knew by this time
that her consent was a mere question of time.
His wooing might be tedious, but it could not be
difficult; and as he took his way down the valley,
he found himself thinking about the marriage
service, and picturing to himself how exquisite
Phemie would look as a bride.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ere a week was over, she had promised, reluctantly
possibly, but still faithfully, to become
his wife some day; and the officer went about in a
seventh heaven of ecstacy, whilst Mr. Aggland sat
gravely looking on, and Duncan sang in a broad
Scotch dialect, which was fortunately unintelligible
to the lover, though Phemie understood it
all too well—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

      <div class='line'>“He wandered hame wearie—the nicht it was drearie,</div>

    </div>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='c009'>SATISFIED.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Having won Phemie Keller, the next thing
Captain Stondon desired was to wed her. It
might have made the heart of many a matchmaking
mother ache with envy to hear how the
man hammered on at that one string.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the refrain of every sentence. Mr. Aggland
and he never separated without the subject
being mooted by this fortunate lover. Vainly did
the farmer assert that the girl was too young, that
there was time enough, that nobody was going to
run away with her. Captain Stondon would listen
to no objections. Christmas was coming on, and
he must get back to Norfolk immediately, and he
wanted to have something definite decided on
before he went away.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>To all of which Mr. Aggland listened gravely
ere he replied—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I tell you what, Captain Stondon: let
me go to Norfolk with you, and there we will talk
about the future. You must not think,” proceeded
Mr. Aggland, hastily, “that because I say
this I am ‘a kind of burr—I shall stick.’ I do
not mean to intrude. I have no intention of
forcing myself upon you. Once let me see the
place where Phemie is going to, the home in
which she is to live, and you need never fear
sign or token of me again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I hope and trust that I shall,” answered
Captain Stondon: “I do not want to separate
Phemie from her friends. I have no wish to do
anything of the kind. You surely have not
thought me so forgetful—so ungrateful as all
that comes to?” cried the officer, growing quite
vehement over the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Mr. Aggland shook his head and answered,
“I do not think you either ungrateful or forgetful,
only I know that, when once you and Phemie
are married, the less she and you are troubled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>with any of us the better it will be for her. It is
never a pleasant thing for a woman to be constantly
reminded whence she has been transplanted,
and Phemie is young enough to take
kindly to a new soil and root herself firmly in it.
Further, sir; though I was once humble companion
to a gentleman’s son, I hope I never wore</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The rags of any great man’s looks, nor fed</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon their after meals.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And because I am so sure of my own mind in
this matter—so positive that I do not want Phemie
to feel anyone belonging to her a burden, I have
no scruple in asking you to let me go to Norfolk.
I shall be able to give her away with a lighter
heart when I have once looked on the house that
is to be her home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Doubtless Mr. Aggland was right; but Captain
Stondon, with his heart full of generous projects,
with a vivid memory of all he owed to the farmer’s
care and kindness, felt that this constant assertion
of independence—this everlasting refusal to come
up and stand on the same level with himself—was
irritating in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>It is so hard to have one’s best intention
doubted—to see people thinking they are wiser
and better than everybody else on earth—to have
good gifts tossed back in one’s face, that Captain
Stondon often felt inclined to tell Mr. Aggland
that independence may be carried far too far;
that there is an extreme point at which every
virtue touches a vice; and that the most dangerous
pride is, after all, the pride that “apes
humility.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But as often as he felt inclined he refrained.
He remembered that, to a man like Mr. Aggland,
poverty was the most severe trial to which his
character could have been subjected; and he recollected
likewise that, if an ungenial climate had
made the fruit of his life somewhat bitter, it had
not rendered it unwholesome.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides, he, Captain Stondon, was so happy
that he could afford to be tolerant of the short-comings
of others; and accordingly he answered,
good-humouredly—</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will know me better some day, Aggland.
Meantime, come to Norfolk, and we can arrange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>about settlements and other matters when once
we get there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One thing more,” said Mr. Aggland. “I pay
my own expenses.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Agreed,” replied Captain Stondon, laughing;
“so long as you do not ask me to send you in a
bill for board and lodging at Marshlands, you can
pay what you like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so the matter was settled; and for letting
Mr. Aggland have his own way the officer received
his reward.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never had the Hill Farm been made pleasanter
to him than it was during the week which intervened
between the time the journey was proposed
and the hour they started.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everyone seemed now to feel that matters were
finally settled, and that there was, therefore,
nothing more to be done except to put on
holiday faces, and make matters agreeable for
Phemie and Captain Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>What if the boys did tease their cousin? It
only made a little more life about the Farm.
What if Johnny King had the audacity to answer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Captain Stondon’s question as to whether
Mr. Aggland was at home with a wink and
a shrug, and a hand pointed over his shoulder,
and
“No, he is not; but Phemie is in there; and
father says she is all you want at the Hill Farm!”
The officer only boxed the young monkey’s ears,
and went on his way with a light step, whilst
Phemie’s whole time was taken up in expostulating
and remonstrating.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Uncle, are they to torment me? Uncle, is
Duncan to say the things he does? Is he to go
about the house singing, ‘Woo’d, and married,
and a’?’—more particularly when Captain Stondon
is here. It is enough to put a person from
being married at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The lassie is glaikit wi’ pride,” remarked
Duncan, from a safe distance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Lord has been very good to her to put
such a chance in her way,” added Mrs. Aggland,
sanctimoniously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Blest if I don’t think Phemie is right, and
that it is enough to prevent her marrying at all,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>hearing so much about it,” said Mr. Aggland; but
for all that the boys would teaze, and Mrs. Aggland
would talk concerning the wedding clothes,
and Peggy M‘Nab would spend hours tracing out
a brilliant future for her darling. On the whole,
that future was by no means one to be scoffed at
by a country girl whose entire fortune was under
a couple of hundred pounds, and whose well-born
relations refused to recognise her. It was very
pleasant to become in a moment a person of importance—very
charming to be the sun round
which the whole household revolved—very delightful
to have Mrs. Aggland alternately fawning
upon her and making envious speeches.</p>

<p class='c011'>Already Phemie was beginning to feel the
beneficial change in her position, and from the
height she had attained she was able clearly to
see the inferiority of the station from which Captain
Stondon had raised her. Distant, and more
distant still, grew the heroes of her romantic
visions. They were real men to her no more;
and she could even smile to herself as she repeated
a verse of Carrick’s “Rose of the Canongate,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>a song she had learned in the old manse by
the sea-shore:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“She dream’d of lords, of knights, of squires,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And men of high degree;</div>
      <div class='line'>But lords were scarce and knights were shy,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So ne’er a joe had she.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps a letter Mr. Aggland received from her
aunt, Miss Keller, in answer to one he wrote informing
the Keller family of Captain Stondon’s
proposals, and Phemie’s acceptance of them, had
a little to do with this desirable change in her
sentiments. “Miss Keller presented her compliments
to Mr. Aggland, and on behalf of herself
and her brother, General Keller, begged to inform
Mr. A. that they were happy to hear the young
person referred to in his letter was likely to be
comfortably provided for. At the same time, as
Lieutenant Keller’s unhappy marriage had severed
all ties of relationship between them, General and
Miss Keller trusted that Mr. Aggland would not
think it necessary to enter into any further correspondence,
as it was impossible for either General
or Miss Keller to recognise in any way the
child of such a degrading and ill-assorted union.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“Never mind, my darling,” said Captain Stondon,
when Phemie showed him this gracious
epistle. “You can do without them, I hope;”
and the girl was grateful for the tone in which
the words were spoken, and thought more and
more that things were not so bad as they seemed
at first, and that she had great cause for thankfulness.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had to keep a guard on her lips and refrain
from wishing for anything, for so surely as she said
she would fancy this, or something else, so surely it
was purchased for her. If she had expressed a
desire for the moon, Captain Stondon would
straightway have set to work thinking how he
might best procure it; and Phemie could often
have bitten a piece off her tongue after she had
exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should like this. I wish I had that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seems as if I were always taking—taking,
and I cannot bear it,” she said once, piteously;
and Mr. Aggland coming to the rescue, said he
could not bear it either.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The girl will forget how to say any other word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>than ‘thank you’” he added; “you are making
a perfect parrot of her. Give her what you like
when once she is your wife, but hold your hand
now;” and Captain Stondon agreed to do what
they asked him on condition that the Norfolk
journey was undertaken without delay.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When once she is my wife she shall not need
to wish,” he said; from which speech it will be
seen that Phemie’s future husband had laid himself
out to spoil her completely, if he could; and
meantime he made so much of her—was so patient,
so good, and kind, that Phemie, poor child, cried
when he went away, and caused the man to fall
more rapturously in love with her than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>If the weather had been better, the journey to
London could have left nothing to be desired;
but as it was, with the snow on the ground, Captain
Stondon acknowledged to himself that, but for
Mr. Aggland, he should have found the way between
Carlisle and Euston Square of the longest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having Mr. Aggland, the time passed rapidly
enough. They talked a good deal, they slept a
good deal; and by-and-by, when they both awoke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>about Stafford, Mr. Aggland roused himself thoroughly,
and began to show his companion what
really was in him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He told tales of his own long ago: his boyhood’s
scrapes, his manhood’s chances, the various
adventures he had met with in the course of an
irregular rambling life. The excitement of travelling,
the sight of so many strange faces, the
change and variety of going back after years to
London, seemed to make a different creature of
the individual who had always hitherto seemed to
Captain Stondon a clever, eccentric “wild man of
the hills.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If he would but shave himself and get his
hair cut, and buy a respectable suit of clothes, he
might pass anywhere,” thought the officer; but
he would as soon have dreamed of suggesting any
alteration in his attire to the Commander-in-Chief
as to Mr. Aggland, for which reason, though every
one they met, stared at the man as they might at
a maniac, Captain Stondon appeared perfectly unconscious
of the fact; and for any remark he
made, Phemie’s uncle might have been “got up”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>like the greatest dandy that ever walked down
Bond Street.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only—he told the cabman to drive to an hotel
in the City instead of to the “Burlington,” where
he usually stopped, alleging as his reason that he
wanted to be near the Shoreditch Station, so as
to get on to Norfolk betimes the next morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the next morning came, however, Mr.
Aggland asked whether his companion would object
to putting off their journey for a few hours.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see,” he said, “there is an afternoon train
which arrives at Disley about nine o’clock in the
evening. If that would suit you equally well, I
should prefer it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no objection,” answered Captain Stondon.
“I must telegraph down, though, for them
to meet us at the nine train, for otherwise I do not
see exactly how we should ever get over from Disley
to Marshlands.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” said Mr. Aggland; “and would
you—would you—mind my leaving you alone for
a short time?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The man actually coloured as he asked this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>and after he had departed, Captain Stondon fell
to wondering where his companion could be gone—on
what secret mission he could have departed
by himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He surely has not seen some pretty woman
and fallen in love with her,” soliloquised the
officer; and then his thoughts went back to the
pretty girl he had fallen in love with in Cumberland,
and whom he hoped to have all to himself
when next he passed through London.</p>

<p class='c011'>How little he expected, when he was in town
before, ever to marry—ever to see anybody again
for whom he could care in the least; and now he
was lying on a sofa in one of the sitting-rooms in
the Castle and Falcon, building all kinds of beautiful
edifices, while the City traffic thundered along
Aldersgate Street, till finally, with its very monotony,
it lulled him to sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>How long he slept he did not know, but at last
he awoke with a start, and found a stranger sitting
opposite to the sofa he occupied—a stranger,
yet not a stranger—a person who was unknown to
him, and yet whose face seemed familiar. Captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Stondon raised himself on his elbow to inquire
who his visitor might be, but in the same
moment recognised him, and exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good heavens, Aggland! what have you been
doing to yourself? I could not, for the life of
me, think who you were.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And indeed it was no marvel that Captain
Stondon had been mystified; for Mr. Aggland
who entered the Castle and Falcon at one o’clock
was certainly remarkably unlike the Mr. Aggland
who walked out of it at eleven. He had gone to a
hair-dresser’s, he had gone to a tailor, and the consequence
was that he came back another person.
Hitherto his head had looked like the wings of an
old raven that is moulting; now dexterous hands
had brushed and smoothed his hair till it seemed
really to be human hair, and not the mane of a
wild colt. His moustache had been as the bristles
of a well-worn hearth-broom; and heaven only
knows through what torments of fixatrice he had
passed in order to get it into decent trim. His
whiskers had resembled nothing so much as long,
bare, straggling branches of the hop plant; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>the barber’s skill having pruned away all the
impoverishing suckers, the original hair on his
cheeks remained trim and neat as could have
been desired.</p>

<p class='c011'>At his clothes Captain Stondon stared in
amazement. About the legs and shoulders, about
his feet and arms, Mr. Aggland was now as other
men.</p>

<p class='c011'>Excepting that he still wore his shirt-collar
turned down—a fashion which in those days was
not in vogue—the farmer looked quite like ordinary
mortals. He had compassed that metamorphosis
which Captain Stondon so earnestly desired
to see; and having compassed this end, it
is only fair to add that Mr. Aggland looked desperately
ashamed of himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he had thought it right to give heed to
such vanities for Phemie’s sake; and a sense
of duty consequently supported him through his
trial.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not care to go to your place looking an
old guy,” he explained, awkwardly enough; “and
as I should have had, sooner or later, to buy a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>few things for the wedding, I have bought them
sooner instead of later—that is all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You do my place too much honour,” answered
Captain Stondon; but he wished, even as he said
it, that he could be quite sure Mr. Aggland had
not guessed what was passing through his mind
as they journeyed southward together.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had forgotten what keen vision living
among the hills insures; he had not thought of
the quick sensitiveness which catches at an idea
from a look, a movement, a chance glance.</p>

<p class='c011'>However, Mr. Aggland was all the more presentable
for the change in his attire, and as he
proceeded to say, how he had thought the day
might come when somebody in Norfolk would
know he was Phemie’s uncle, and that therefore—and
to do such credit as he could to Captain
Stondon—he wanted to make the best of himself,
the officer was quite touched by the man’s unselfish
thoughtfulness, by the love and affection
which had compelled him to make an exertion
that a weaker nature would have been ashamed
to confess.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Everything he saw about the farmer made him
regret more and more that his life had proved so
hard an one for himself, so profitless an one for
others; and this feeling made him treat his new
friend in a manner which induced Mr. Aggland
afterwards to declare to Phemie—</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I had been a king, child, he could not have
made more of me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor was Mr. Aggland, who had seen some fine
estates in his lifetime, less impressed with the
stateliness of Marshlands than with the courtesy
of its owner.</p>

<p class='c011'>The house was “far and away grander than
Worton Court,” he told his niece, and if Mr.
Aggland had entertained any doubts on the subject
of Captain Stondon’ s social standing, his visit
to Marshlands completely undeceived him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He passed a week there—a whole week, though
he had declared he “couldna, shouldna, daurna
stay for more than a couple of days;” and many
a long talk had he and Captain Stondon, sitting
over the library fire, whilst dessert remained
untouched beside them, and each forgot to pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>the decanter which contained some of that
“inimitable ’24 port.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was great promotion for Phemie. The
longer Mr. Aggland stayed at Marshlands, and
the more he saw of the master of Marshlands, the
more unreal the whole affair seemed; and he
went meekly back to Cumberland, feeling that
neither he nor his could ever have made the girl
half so happy as it was in both the power and the
will of this rich gentleman to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>The marriage was to take place in the spring,
and Captain Stondon wanted to provide Phemie’s
trousseau; but on this point Mr. Aggland was
firm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is no use in the child bringing her two
or three halfpence in her hand to you,” he said,
not without a certain sadness; “and so we may
just as well spend her little fortune on the only
thing she is ever likely to have to provide for
herself. She shall not disgrace any of us, I promise
you that; and till she is your wife, I would
rather she was not indebted to you for anything.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>As usual, there was so much sense in what Mr.
Aggland said, that Captain Stondon had to yield
the point; and the consequence was that the
farmer returned from London with such a quantity
of luggage as caused his wife to stand
aghast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! Peggy; oh! Peggy,” cried Phemie Keller.
“Those boxes are like something out of fairyland:
there are silks and laces, and muslins and ribbons,
and the most enchanting kid shoes, and kid
gloves, Peggy—French gloves, like Lady Wauthrope’s.
And whatever more I want, uncle says
is to be ordered from Liverpool; but I shall never
wear all those things out. I could not do it if I
were to live for a thousand years. Come and
look at them, and then tell me if you believe I
am Phemie Keller. It is something like what we
used to talk about, Peggy. Do you remember
how we used to talk?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, bairn, I mind it weel.” The time Miss
Phemie dreamed her dreams was not so very far
remote but that any one could recollect it. “And
it seems to me, when I’m thinking ower it a’, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the Yerl has come across the hills to tak’ my
darling frae me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you shall come too. I asked him about
it, and he said, ‘Yes, of course;’ so you must
get a trousseau, Peggy, and travel with us wherever
we go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye dinna want an auld fule like me to wait
on ye,” answered Peggy; “an if ye did, I’d rather
stay i’ the house I ken sae weel, wi’ the maister
who has been aye sae gude to me, than gang
roamin’ about the warld. But when ye are a
great lady, mind I always said this would come
to pass; for if he is not an yerl, he is as rich as
one, I’ll be bound.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I am sure he is kinder to me than any
duke in the land could be,” agreed Phemie; but
Phemie sighed for all that—a deep sigh—for the
vanished hopes, for the dream hero that could
return to her no more!</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='c009'>FOR LIFE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Spring came to the sweet valley of Tordale—came
with its flowers and sunshine—its showers—its
springing grass—its budding trees—its
balmy winds—its wealth of promise—across the
hills and up the ravine.</p>

<p class='c011'>By the dark green of the yarrow under foot—by
the anemones and hyacinths blooming beneath
the trees—by the soft cushions of lady’s-fingers—by
the scent of the clover in the meadows—by
the ragged-robin trailing through the hedges—by
the saxifrage growing beside the waterfall—by
the ferns daintily unfolding their leaves—by the
delicate colour of the moss covering the boulders—you
could tell as you passed by that Spring
had come, and was decking herself in robes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>coolest verdure, to greet the richer beauty of the
summer.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the young lambs were dotted about on
the mountain sides—when marsh-marigolds and
gowans were to be gathered in handfuls—when
the streams and rills were dancing over the
stones and making sweet melody as they sped
along, thankful the winter snows were melted,
the winter frosts thawed—Phemie Keller was
married.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ere ever the wild roses put forth buds—ere
ever the honeysuckle climbing among thorn and
briar and bramble began to scent the air with its
delicious fragrance—in the spring-time of her
young life—in the first bloom and blush of her
rare loveliness—Phemie became a wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the midst of the congregation, Captain
Stondon met her a stranger—from the midst of
the congregation he took her for himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had he ever wanted to be rid of his bargain—to
back out of the engagement entered into,
where the Cumberland hills frowned down on
Tordale Church—he would have found it no easy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>matter to do so, for the whole parish might have
been summoned as witnesses on Phemie’s behalf.</p>

<p class='c011'>The shepherds left their sheep to the tender
mercies of the coolies—the farmers put on their
best suits and plodded up the valley to Tordale
Church—the eggs were not collected—the milk
was not churned—the children did not go to
school on that fine spring morning when Phemie
Keller was married.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had privacy been desired, privacy would have
been in Tordale simply impossible; and as no
secret was made of the day or the hour, as everybody
had known for weeks previously when the
ceremony was to take place, the church was
literally crammed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many a one who had never gone to hear Mr.
Conbyr preach went to hear him read the words
that made the bride and bridegroom one—went
to see the grand gentleman, who was popularly
supposed to have so much money that he did not
know what to do with it, taking to wife Daniel
Aggland’s niece—bonnie Phemie, who, for all her
great fortune, for all her fine clothes, looked pale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>and frightened, or, as one of the spectators
remarked, “fiate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is a most serious deal of difference,” he
added, shaking his head solemnly; “she’s but a
bairn, with her glintin’ hair, and her soft blue
eyes, and her jimp waist that I could ’most span
with my one hand. She’s but a bairn, while he”—and
the man took a long look at Captain
Stondon, who was standing bare-headed, with the
sunshine streaming full upon him—“Go’nows
<em>how</em> old he is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I should like to be able to sketch that interior
for you, my reader. I should like to show you
the men and the women and the children who
filled the church, and looked with grave, interested
faces at the group standing before the altar.
I should like to paint for you the way the sunbeams
fell on Phemie’s hair, turning each thread
to gold—how they showed her pale pure face to
every soul in the church—how in her white dress
she looked more lovely than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Agglands were there, all of them—all
Phemie’s relations, excepting the Kellers—all her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>friends—all her acquaintances—all who knew
anything about her—were gathered together on
that bright spring morning; but Captain Stondon
had no one belonging to him present on the
occasion. Even his best man was no fine gentleman
from London, but merely a stray curate
from Grassenfel, who could not have seemed more
uncomfortable had he been going to be married
himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Already Captain Stondon had found that the
position of his wife’s family in the social scale
placed him in an awkward dilemma. There are
always certain embarrassments entailed by differences
of rank which are felt by Love the moment
he walks out of doors with the lady of his
choice.</p>

<p class='c011'>The world cares for Mammon, though Cupid
may not. Society is apt to make merry over the
ways and manners of those who are not the <i><span lang="fr">crême
de la crême</span></i>, while the happy pair are absorbed in
one another. The wedding at Tordale would have
shocked the sensitive nerves of Captain Stondon’s
intimates; and, accordingly, prudently and sensibly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>he refrained from making himself a laughing-stock
among his friends.</p>

<p class='c011'>When we are at Rome we do as Rome does.
When we are in the world we conform to its
usages; and though Captain Stondon was marrying
out of the world, he still meant to return to
the world and take his bride thither with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The absence of all hypercritical guests was best
for both Phemie and her uncle. They had admitted
as much to one another; and yet the fact
of none of the bridegroom’s friends being present
hurt them, and showed them clearly, as if the
future had been spread out before their eyes, that
from all old associations—from all old friends—from
all old habits—Phemie Keller was passing
swiftly away.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the shadow fades from the hill-side, leaving
no trace of where it has rested, so auburn hair and
blue eyes was passing away from the old familiar
life—from the rugged mountain scenery—from
the drip of the waterfall—from the calm peacefulness—from
the sweet monotony of that remote
valley for ever.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>She might come back again, but never the
Phemie she had been; never again might she look
out on life as she had done from the windows
of her dream castle; she might never more gaze
upon the mountains with the same eyes; she
might never speak with the same thoughts and
wishes swelling in her heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was going out to be another Phemie; in
a different rank; with different aims, and hopes,
and objects; with a difficult part to play; with a
difficult path to follow: no wonder that as the
farmers’ wives saw the tears filling her eyes, and
rolling down her cheeks, they said, with an intuitive,
unreasoning pity, “God help her; and she
so young!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So young; that was the string everybody harped
on. It never seemed to have occurred to them
before, that she was barely more than a child, till
they came to see her pledging her whole future—all
the long, long years she had in all human
probability before her—away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many a one present had not liked Phemie over
much in days gone by. They had thought her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>conceited, fanciful, stuck up; but now that she
was being made a lady of—now that the whole
country side had been bidden to a marriage feast
at the Hill Farm, and that the girl, in her sorrow
and trouble at leaving everything behind her, had
gone to bid even the veriest virago in Tordale
good-bye—her short-comings were forgotten, and
nothing but her youth and beauty remembered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her fine clothes, that she had been so proud to
exhibit, were never thought of; the grand match
she was making, and of which some present had
been very jealous, faded out of recollection; and
for the time being her young face, her girlish
figure, filled every heart with a vague pity.
Something was wanting in that bridal group, and
the spectators felt the want as they looked at
the child giving herself to this man so long as he
lived or as she lived.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was not a person present—unless, indeed,
it might be Mr. Aggland—who could have defined
his or her sensations; but, nevertheless, every one
felt the absence of that intangible something
which Phemie Keller might never now become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>acquainted with, sinlessly, through all the years
to come.</p>

<p class='c011'>That was it—for better, for worse—she was
resigning all hope, all chance of happy love; love
with its bliss and agony; love with its doubts
and distractions; love without which no life, be
it otherwise ever so symmetrical, can be perfect.
Attachment—affection—a calm, even, unruffled
existence is better, some tell you, than the hot and
the cold, the fever and the collapse, the mad pulse
and the shivering agony. It may be so. God
knows what is best for us: God knew what was
best for Phemie Keller!</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet as the “keld” comes darkling upon
the surface of the Cumberland lakes, without
cloud, without wind, without shadow, without reason
that we can trace, so in the middle of the
sunshine, in the middle of the prosperity, a “keld”
seemed to gather on the waters of Phemie’s life;
those clear waters that were as yet unruffled by
passion, untroubled by regret.</p>

<p class='c011'>For she was, as they all said, young. She
was such a child that her composure was disturbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>by Davie, who had thought it incumbent
upon him to come and see the ceremony, like his
neighbours.</p>

<p class='c011'>A wise dog, he followed the wedding party from
the Hill Farm at a distance, and had slunk into
the church in an unassuming, undemonstrative
manner, with his tail between his legs, doubtless
hoping by this manœuvre to escape observation.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Mrs. Aggland, ever lynx-eyed, spied him
out, and bade Duncan take him home; an order
which Duncan disputed in so loud a whisper that
the controversy attracted the attention of one of
the shepherds, who secured the dog, and placed
him between his legs, from which position Davie
surveyed the ceremony with sorrowful eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the company began to disperse, Davie
walked out with the first, but waited, like a Christian,
in the church porch for Phemie.</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew as well as anybody there that she was
going from him. Many a pleasant mile they had
walked together over the hills; many a score times
she had called him to follow her to Strammer
Tarn; many a morning they had run down the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>hill-side and across the valley when the sun was
looking at them over Helbeck in the glad summer,
or in the dreary winter, when Phemie looked back
gleefully to see her footprints in the snow. They
had climbed together; they had rested among the
heather; she had twined wild flowers round his
neck, an attention he had not then appreciated;
she had loved him and been good to him; and now
it was all over, and Davie knew it, and because he
knew it, he did not jump upon her, or fawn, or
gambol, or bark as she came out.</p>

<p class='c011'>He only wagged his dilapidated tail from side
to side, and licked her hand, and looked up in
her face, and said farewell as plainly as a dumb
brute can.</p>

<p class='c011'>At which performance Phemie—Phemie Keller
no longer—broke out crying, to the dismay of
Captain Stondon, who hurried her through the
churchyard and down the steps, inwardly anathematizing
Davie in particular, and the lookers on in
general.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s all along of you,” remarked Mrs. Aggland,
giving Duncan a shake. “If you had taken the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>dog back, as I told you, she would have been all
right. Was ever woman plagued as I am by a set
of disobedient, headstrong boys?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you wouldn’t have liked to go home
yourself,” retorted Duncan; whilst Mr. Aggland,
with a troubled look in his face, muttered as
he walked along, leading Helen by the hand—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“An auld head set on shouthers young,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The like was never seen;</div>
      <div class='line'>For bairnies will be bairnies aye,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>As they hae ever been.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But he was thinking of something else all the
while. He was thinking about Phemie; thinking,
as he had never thought before, of the future
she was going out to meet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Keep up, Phemie; be brave,” he found an
opportunity of whispering to her, and the girl
dried her tears, and smiled her best, and laughed
when her husband broke the bridecake over her
head, after the fashion of the country, while the
young men and the young women contended for
the very crumbs eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Captain Stondon was happy again. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>forgave Duncan and he forgave the inhabitants of
Tordale, and he made himself so agreeable while
Phemie was getting ready for her departure, that
the bride’s youth and the bride herself were
forgotten, and everybody joined in praises of the
officer, and wishes for his health, happiness, and
prosperity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The guests were going to keep up the feast till
night, or at least so long as their heads remained
tolerably steady, but the bride and bridegroom had
to start early in the afternoon to catch the train
at Carlisle, from which place Phemie had elected
to go to Scotland to spend her honeymoon.</p>

<p class='c011'>After that Captain Stondon proposed travelling,
on the Continent, and the girl did not know when
she should see her uncle or Cumberland again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope you will be happy, Phemie,” he said;
“I believe you will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I shall, uncle,” she answered; but the
tears were in her eyes as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have something to say to you before you go,”
he began; “something that came into my mind
as I followed you home from church.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“What is it?” she asked. “What is it?” she
repeated, seeing that he paused and hesitated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I was sending Duncan out into the world,”
he said, “I should warn him that it is a sinful
world; that though it may not be hard to keep
straight in a lonely place like this, it is not so
easy to be good with temptations surrounding us
on every side——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, uncle,” agreed Phemie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Burns says,” proceeded Mr. Aggland, “that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Gentlemen an’ ladies worst,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Wi’ ev’ndown want o’ wark are curst.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Now you are going to be a lady, Phemie, and a
lady out in the world, and I do not want you to lose
your head in consequence; I do not want you to
live an objectless, useless, idle life. Chaucer tells
us truly that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘An ydil man is like an hous that hath norne walls,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The deviles may enter on every syde;’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and an idle woman’s position is quite as bad,
Phemie, quite.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I shall not be idle,” she pleaded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will not have to work,” he answered,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“and that with many is synonymous with idleness.
You are going to you know not what, my
child,” he went on; “you are going into a strange
world, where there are strange fashions, strange
creeds, strange ideas of morality. Phemie, you
will keep yourself straight; you won’t forget
what I have tried to teach you; you won’t forget
what your grandfather taught you; you won’t
forget this world is not all, and that its fashions
and its pleasures pass swiftly away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will try to be good, uncle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will have servants under you,” he continued.
“Don’t be hard with them, Phemie;
don’t be thoughtless. Remember they have souls
to be saved as well as you. You have beauty.
It is an article much prized where you are going.
Don’t be too vain of it. Remember God gave it
to you—a gift not to be abused. Never forget
that, unless allied to something better, it is
but—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lost, faded, broken, dead within an hour.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>You will be rich; when you are so, ‘be not
exalted,’ as Cleobulus pithily puts it. Solomon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>says, ‘riches are not for ever;’ remember that;
and also that for the use you make of them while
you have them you will be held accountable. I
would have you emulate those—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Great souls, who touch’d with warmth divine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Give gold a price, and teach its teams to shine;</div>
      <div class='line'>All hoarded pleasures they repute a load,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor think their wealth their own, till well bestowed.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>But you are going into a world so new and
strange that all old counsels, all old teachings,
seem inapplicable to it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Mr. Aggland dropped his hand despairingly
on Phemie’s shoulder as he concluded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will try to remember,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would have you—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>‘Strive in youth</div>
      <div class='line'>To save your age from care,’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>continued her uncle. “I would have you keep
every Christian grace, every womanly virtue. I
do not wish to see you a fashionable lady. Do
not at first be too confident, but proceed—</p>

      <div class='line'>‘Like one that on a lonesome road</div>
      <div class='line'>Doth walk in fear and dread.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And yet I would not have you over-fearful, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>cowardly, because I know ‘that what begins in
fear usually ends in folly.’ I want you to keep a
balance, Phemie, between bigotry and irreligion—between
virtue and prudery—between hard work
and idleness—between confidence and presumption.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish I had not to go away at all, uncle,”
was her comment on this string of advice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you had not to go away I should not have
to warn you,” he answered. “And now good-bye,
and don’t forget me, Phemie; don’t quite forget
me, if you can help it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was parting from the girl he had loved like
his own daughter; parting from her who was
going forth on an untried, uncertain road; and if
the tears did come into his eyes, if his voice did
tremble for a moment, I hope those who read
these pages will not think him the less a man for
all that.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for Phemie, seeing him in such trouble, she
kept her own trouble back bravely. She would
not cry; she would not unfit herself for saying
what she knew was the truth, that she could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>never forget him, nor forget the Hill Farm; and
she took his hand and kissed it ere he could prevent
her, while she whispered—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The mother may forget the child</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That smiles sae sweetly on her knee,</div>
      <div class='line'>But I’ll remember thee, Glencairn,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And a’ that thou hast done for me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>And then she broke down—then she threw herself
into his arms and lay sobbing there till
Helen came to remind her time was getting on,
and that railway trains wait for no one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must go now, Phemie,” said her uncle;
“do not think me unkind for hurrying you
away—</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘I have too grieved a heart to take a tedious leave.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There now. Let’s not unnerve each other,” and
he put her gently back from him. “And now
for my last words. Remember that you are
but an—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Unlessoned girl, unschooled, unpractised.</div>
      <div class='line'>Happy in this—you are not yet so old</div>
      <div class='line'>But you may learn.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Be a good wife to the man who has chosen you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>and whom you have chosen. ‘Do him good,
and not evil, all the days of your life.’ Now,
Phemie, now—now,” and he unclasped the arms
she had thrown round him once again, and bade
her say what other farewells she had to say, as
it was high time they were off to Carlisle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall come back again,” Phemie said to
each and all. “I shall come back again, Duncan.
I will indeed, Helen. Be sure I won’t stay long
away, Peggy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Peggy M‘Nab refused to be comforted.
She went into her kitchen after the happy pair
drove away, and covered her head with her
apron, and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t cry, Peggy!—don’t, don’t!” exclaimed
Helen, with the tears streaming down her own
cheeks; “don’t cry; she will come back to us;
you heard her say yourself that she would.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alake, Miss Helen,” answered Peggy, from
behind her curtain of blue check, “the child that
I carried in my airms—that I nursed in my lap—I
have not seen this many a year, unless, maybe,
by an odd time in a dream; and your cousin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Phemie, who has just gane awa’, neither you nor
me will ever set eyes on again till our deein’
day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At which assurance Helen lifted up her voice
and wept aloud, for she did not understand the
exact meaning of the hard truth contained in
Peggy’s pathetic words. And if she had, would
she have wept the less? Would she have ceased
lamenting? Would it have been any consolation
to her to know that another Phemie might come
back, but that the Phemie who had danced over
the heather, and sat by Strammer Tarn, and
assisted in all household duties; who had been
gay and sad, happy and sorrowful, could return to
the Hill Farm—to the peace and quiet of the
valley below—to the rugged mountains—to the
murmuring waterfall—never more—ah, never!</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class='c009'>DISAPPOINTED.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Montague Stondon, Esquire, barrister-at-law,
heir presumptive to Marshlands, fifteenth, or
twentieth, or thirtieth cousin, or something
equally near of kin to the man who had just
taken unto himself a wife, lived in Chapel Street,
Grosvenor Place, in a house which commanded in
front a cheerful view of the other side of the way,
and at the back looked out over Tattersall’s to St.
George’s Hospital.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not a large house, it was not a convenient
one, it was far and away too expensive for Mr.
Stondon’s means; but it was sufficiently genteel,
it was within five minutes of the Row, it was close
to the Green Park, it touched elbows with Belgrave
Square, and altogether suited the barrister
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>as well as any house is ever likely to suit any man
who is overwhelmed with debt, and who, having
the tastes of a millionaire, is often at his wits’ end
to know where to raise twenty pounds.</p>

<p class='c011'>If you are not bidden to a banquet, I cannot see
the precise pleasure that accrues from beholding
others partaking of it. If you have not the means
to visit with his Grace the Duke, it is beyond my
capacity to understand why you should pay fabulous
rents for the mere enjoyment of living near
his Grace, and seeing her Grace’s carriage pass
your door; but Montague Stondon felt that there
was a satisfaction in residing within call of nobility,
and that their footmen, their equipages, their crests,
and coats of arms conferred a certain importance
on him. The earth would not be a very cheerful
dwelling-place if it were beyond reach of the sun’s
rays, and in the opinion of Montague Stondon the
sun never rose except about Belgrave Square and
those other regions affected by the nobility and
gentry of England.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he rode out on his hired horse, he could
be in the midst of rank and fashion immediately;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>he could take his fine whiskers into the Park and
air them there, while he gnawed the handle of
his riding-whip, and wondered how the deuce he
was to carry on for a year or two longer.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Mrs. Stondon, a faded fashionable woman,
who had brought her husband some fortune, “received,”
she liked to think that the carriages of
her visitors and the carriages of the great people
hard by touched wheels in the street.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was nice to lie on the sofa and listen to the
thundering double knocks powdered footmen were
giving in the neighbouring square; it would have
been impossible to have ordered goods home, if
home had chanced to be outside the radius of
fashion; it would have done Basil harm at school
had his parents not lived in a genteel quarter; it
would have been fatal to him at college had the
parental letters been dated from any locality less
desirable than Chapel Street.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fashion—even the flimsiest and falsest kind of
fashion—was a good to be purchased at any price,
at any risk. They had been used to it—they had
been accustomed to terrible dinner parties, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>crowded assemblies, to boxes at the Opera, to all
the hundred weary pleasures which so many
Londoners consider necessary to their very existence;
and the consequence was that, as they
could not relinquish any of their usual indulgences,
they got more and more involved while the
years went by, and less and less able to extricate
themselves from their embarrassments.</p>

<p class='c011'>But for the hope of Marshlands, but for the idea
that some day they should have money in plenty,
life would scarcely have been supportable. As it
was, they went on their way, trusting that news
would soon come of Captain Stondon’s death, and
of their own accession to fortune.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What right has a man like that to own such
a property?” demanded Mrs. Montague Stondon.
“He might just as well give it to us for all the
enjoyment he takes out of it. I am positive he
cannot spend more than five hundred a year!”
and the lady sighed at the idea of Marshlands
belonging to a person who could so limit his
personal expenditure.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for his profession, Montague Stondon made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>very little of it. If he possessed any natural
abilities he never used them. If there was money
to be earned at the Bar, scarcely any of it found
its way into his pocket. He was good company,
but he was not much of an opinion. He could
shoot better than he could plead; he liked lounging
in his own drawing-room, cantering up the
Row, criticising the latest beauty, far more than
sitting in his chambers or cross-examining witnesses.</p>

<p class='c011'>His manners would have brought him business,
his address made him a favourite with the judges;
but his intense dislike for work, his inordinate
love of pleasure, rendered his career a failure, his
whole existence but a race after amusement, a
longing for dead men’s shoes, a staving-off
of duns, an incessant struggle with debt and
poverty.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is astonishing how miserably poor, people
living in a respectable manner, inhabiting a house
in a desirable neighbourhood, keeping several
servants, eating of the best, sleeping on the softest,
may really be. The sempstress living in Bethnal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Green had not more anxiety for the morrow, more
care for the day, than Montague Stondon, Esq.,
of Chapel Street, Grosvenor Place, who was over
head and ears in debt, and who spent that portion
of his life which he passed in the bosom of
his family in alternately cursing his luck and
praying for the death of his relative.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If that fellow do not soon go home,” he remarked
one morning to his wife, “I shall have to
figure in the ‘Gazette;’ we cannot carry on much
longer as we are doing now!” and he flung down
letter after letter containing requests for debts recently
incurred, more pressing demands for bills of
longer standing, and threats of law from creditors
whose large stock of patience was at last fairly
exhausted. “I am sure I do not know what we
are to do unless we can retrench.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Retrench!” repeated Mrs. Stondon, raising
her light eyebrows at the very idea. “How are
we to do that? If you can show me how it is
possible for us to retrench,” she proceeded, with
quite a show of energy, “I am willing to begin.”
And the lady went on opening her letters, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Montague Stondon took refuge behind the
“Times,” muttering, as he did so,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Willing or not, there will soon have to be
something done, I see that plainly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime Mrs. Stondon read her letters. They
were, as a rule, the customary letters which ladies
write to ladies, crossed as if note-paper had been
ten guineas a quire and postage three shillings
the half ounce; but occasionally there intervened
a short curt note from some indignant milliner,
or a pathetic entreaty for money from a struggling
dressmaker.</p>

<p class='c011'>These Mrs. Stondon dropped as though they
had burnt her fingers; but to the small gossip,
the petty tittle-tattle, the long rambling epistles
of her friendly correspondents, she devoted herself
with praiseworthy earnestness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mary Monk is going to be married,”—these
were the pieces of information to which she
treated her husband—“a very nice match, Mrs.
Monk says. Three thousand a year, and a most
lovely place in Derbyshire. So devotedly attached
to her, and so fond of all her family. Well, Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Monk is fortunate—she has got rid of four out of
the seven now. Julia Enon has another boy, so
there will be no want of heirs there; and Sir John
Martingale has proposed for and been accepted
by a widow who has a hundred thousand pounds
fortune. Caroline wants us to go and stay with
her for a month before she leaves for the Continent,
and Mrs. Leigh hopes we will not forget
them this summer. What a pleasant world this
would be if one had plenty of money!” sighed
Mrs. Stondon, laying down Mrs. Leigh’s letter and
taking up another.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder who this is from?” she said, turning
it over; “post-mark Grassenfel—who do we
know in Grassenfel, Montague?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is the place where Henry was laid-up
at,” answered her husband, his interest excited in
a moment. “I wish to heaven he had broken his
neck there!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush! you should not say such things,” expostulated
his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only think them, I suppose,” was his reply.
“Well, what have you got? What have you got,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>I say?” and he snatched the enclosure out of his
wife’s hand, and read—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Captain Stondon,—Mrs. Stondon</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Damn him!” said Mr. Montague Stondon,
when he had taken in what it all meant. “Damn
her—damn them both!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And having concluded this little commination
service, he looked at his wife, and his wife looked
at him; and then they looked with one accord
at the bills and letters strewing the breakfast-table.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a cursed shame!” broke out Mr. Stondon,
and his brown eyes seemed to grow black
with rage as he spoke; “a man ought to be
locked up for doing such a thing—at his time of
life, too! He must be mad—he has no right to
be at large!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some designing creature, doubtless,” wept
Mrs. Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That cuts Basil out for ever,” said Mr.
Stondon, with another oath.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She may not have any children,” observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>his wife, clutching at the only straw within
reach.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Won’t she?” answered the barrister, “won’t
she? by George! She’ll have scores of them, and
Basil may go and enlist as soon as he likes, for
none of us will ever touch a penny of the Marshlands
rents now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder who she is, Montague? Look in
the ‘Times’ and see if it is there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And it was there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At Tordale, by the Rev. Edward Conbyr,
Vicar—Henry Gower Stondon, Esq., late Captain
in the —th Hussars, to Euphemia, only daughter
of the late Ernest Keller, Esq., and niece of
General Keller, Roundwood, Sussex.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How the deuce did he meet one of the
Roundwood Kellers at Grassenfel?” demanded Mr.
Stondon, and his wife said feebly that she really
did not know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Depend upon it,” went on the barrister,
“there is something queer about the business,
otherwise he never would have kept it so quiet.
There is a screw loose somewhere, but that won’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>do us any good. He might just as well have
broken his neck.” And Montague Stondon, aged
a dozen years in as many minutes, tossed over his
bills with the air of a man who did not know
which way to turn for assistance. “It will bring
them all down upon me,” he said; and he began
swearing once again, when his wife suggested that
perhaps Captain Stondon would help him over his
difficulties and do something for Basil.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You do not know what you are talking
about,” was his reply; “you do not know how
much we owe. It would not take a shilling less
than ten thousand pounds to put us straight, and
you do not expect him to give us that, I suppose,
with a wife in the present, and a tribe of children
coming?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She may not have any family,” repeated Mrs.
Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I tell you she will,” answered her husband.
“Women always have children when you don’t
want them to have any; and even if she have
not, what good will that be to us? She will take
care of him now, and he will live for—God only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>knows how long.” And Mr. Montague Stondon
thrust the ends of his whiskers into his mouth,
and chewed them savagely, while he wrought out
this problem to his own dissatisfaction.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a minute some vague idea of setting to
work even at the eleventh hour—of struggling for
wealth, position, ease—crossed the barrister’s
mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>What was the good of such a life, after all?
Where was the pleasure of running into debt?
What did the opinion of the world signify?
What did it matter whether he met fifty fashionable
people in the course of the day, who were
as perfectly indifferent to him as he was to
them? Was this weary game worth the price of
the candle which he was burning down and down,
day after day, and week after week? Could he
do nothing to retrieve the past? or was it too late
for everything but debt, and duns, and discontent?</p>

<p class='c011'>“If he had any family pride, I would go into
trade to spite him,” said the barrister at last.
“I would take a shop and put on an apron, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>paint Montague Stondon, grocer, up in the High
Street of Disley, as fast as I would walk into the
Park; but he would only say he hoped I should
do a good business, and offer to pay my rent for
the first year, and tell me to send over half a
dozen pounds of tea to Marshlands. Hang him!”
finished Mr. Stondon, with fervour. “I wish he
was being tried for his life at the Old Bailey, and
that I was for the Crown. He should die if he
had fifty lives; he should swing from a gallows
as high as Haman’s, if I had any voice in the
matter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear Montague!” entreated Mrs. Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He might just as well and better have died
in India,” proceeded her husband; “nobody
would have missed him, and I should then have
succeeded to Marshlands. When a man goes out
to India, he is expected to stay there, and he has
no right to come back to stand in the way of his
relations. I wish I was twenty years younger, I
would show Captain Stondon how a man may
get on without Marshlands: but Basil shall work.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>He shall not lead the life I have done. If I
could but get rid of these cursed liabilities, I
would think about him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps Captain Stondon would do something,”
suggested the lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He only paid for his education when he was
single,” retorted the barrister; “do you think he
will do more now he is married?” And Mrs.
Stondon had to take refuge in her private opinion,
which was that the very first time she had a
chance she would “humble herself,” as she expressed
it, to her kinsman, and ask him to help
Mr. Stondon, and to push on her son.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only give me an opportunity,” thought this
wise lady, “and I will improve it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And without saying a word to her husband, the
very day she heard of Captain Stondon’s arrival
in town, she called upon the bride, whom she
offered to take with her to every possible and
impossible place; whom she kissed; whom she
flattered; whom she treated as though Phemie
had been one of the blood royal, or a countess in
her own right.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Then she told Mr. Stondon that he must call
also, and Mr. Stondon called.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The girl is pretty,” he said, on his return
home, “and I do not think she has fooled him.
It is her face that has done it; and somehow or
other, though how I can’t imagine, it is a great
match for her. She has no manners; she has no
confidence; she is just an unfledged country
wench whom he has fallen in love with on account
of her beauty;” and Montague Stondon cursed
her beauty, and wished all women were born a
hundred years old and as ugly as witches. “She
will lead him a pretty dance before long,” finished
the barrister; “why there must be forty years
between them: he might be her grandfather.
Do you know how they happened to meet with
one another, and who made her marry him? for,
of course, she never did it of her own free will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know nothing,” answered Mrs. Montague
Stondon. “I have never seen her alone; he will
not trust her out of his sight. I said if he had
any business to attend to, before he went abroad, I
would try to amuse her; but he said that he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>no business, and that he thought ‘Phemie,’ as he
calls her, would like best to go about with him.
And if you believe me, Montague,” went on the
lady, “the girl said she did not want to go anywhere
without him; an ungrateful minx! and I
think she is fond of him; positively, my dear, I
think she is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So should I be, if he gave me Marshlands,”
answered Mr. Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! but I mean without Marshlands. I
think she is one of those soft, pulpy, characterless
girls who like anybody who is fond of them.
Whatever he says, she agrees with. She does
nothing but blush and answer every question
through him. ‘I do not know what Captain
Stondon intends to do.’ ‘Henry, where shall we
be going to first?’ ‘Shall we return to England this
year, Henry?’ It is Henry this, and Henry that,
and ‘May I, Henry?’—perfectly disgusting, you
know; bad enough when the husband is a boy,
but simply ridiculous when he might be her
great-grandfather.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must try to get something more out of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>when they dine here,” remarked Mr. Stondon;
“you have asked them, have you not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” answered Mrs. Stondon, “and what is
more, they are coming. I thought I never should
have persuaded Captain Stondon, but he ultimately
yielded. I suppose the bride knows
nothing of <i><span lang="fr">les convenances</span></i>, and that he is afraid
of her making some <i><span lang="fr">faux pas</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor little soul!” ejaculated the barrister.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little simpleton,” remarked his wife.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='c009'>ON VIEW.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>When Mrs. Montague Stondon invited her
relations to dine with them in “a quiet way,”
she assured Captain Stondon that she would not
ask more than a couple, or so, of friends to
meet them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will be only a family party,” she declared,
and then forthwith she wrote notes to about
five-and-twenty people, of whom the one-half
had pleasure in accepting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I could not get through the dinner with
that pair alone,” she informed her husband; “and
if we have one or two, we may as well have a
dozen. It is no more trouble, and it is no more
expense; and although Captain Stondon talks so
much about not caring for society, I know he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>would not like to spend an evening <i><span lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>
with us. That is the way with all those kind of
men. They do not know what they want! If
the bride acquits herself creditably he will be as
proud as a peacock, and it shall not be my fault
if she do not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor mine,” added Mr. Stondon, for all which
kind intentions Phemie would have been duly
grateful had she only known of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>As it was, she dreaded that visit as she had
never dreaded anything before in her life, and
the hints and instructions which Captain Stondon
thought it necessary to give only made her
original confusion worse. He told her she must
not do this, and that she must do something else.
He fidgeted about her dress; he would not let
her maid arrange her hair, but sent for an individual
with elaborate whiskers, who made her
head ache, and sent her out unable to bend
her neck.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not think going to Court could be much
worse than this!” sighed Phemie, as she fitted
on her gloves; but she felt comforted when her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>husband surveyed her proudly, and told her she
was the prettiest creature he had ever seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Am I really pretty, Henry?” asked the girl,
who had begun to question her own good looks,
and to value her personal possessions at a much
more modest rate than formerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you really what?” he retorted, holding
her at arm’s length from him, and proudly surveying
her from head to foot. “Are you really
what?—oh, vanity! vanity!” and then Phemie
laughed and blushed to hear again and again that
she was beautiful.</p>

<p class='c011'>But no consciousness of beauty could have
made that dinner-party other than a wretched
ordeal to the young wife. The faces of twelve
strangers whom she had never seen previously,
swam before her. Thirty eyes were always, as
she imagined, riveted on her. If Mr. Stondon
would only have let her alone; if he had only not
tried to make her talk; if the servants could
only have believed that she was not famishing,
and that she did not want a glass of wine every
other minute; if the light had not been so strong;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>if the room had not been so close; if everything
had been different, Phemie thought she could
have managed better: as it was, she envied Mrs.
Stondon, she envied the servants, she envied
every person and any person who knew what was
what, and she envied, beyond all other persons, a
young lady who, owing to there being seven on a
side, sat next to her, and whose composure filled
Phemie with the most intense admiration, not to
say awe.</p>

<p class='c011'>If she had upset her wine, if she had spilled
her soup, if she had taken mint sauce with duck,
if she had kept the whole table waiting, if she had
answered without being spoken to, if she had
dropped her fork, if she had appropriated her
neighbour’s bread, that wonderful woman would
have shown no more sign of embarrassment than
if she had done everything decently and in
order.</p>

<p class='c011'>Talking to a gentleman on her right hand, she
let a morsel of chicken fall from her fork, and the
misadventure made Phemie feel as though she
had committed some sin herself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>“That was a great disappointment,” remarked
the culprit to her, with a charming smile, and
then straightway she observed to her other neighbour,
“which shows people should not try to do
two things at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I could learn to be like her,” thought
Phemie, jealously, “I should not mind paying a
thousand pounds, supposing I had the money.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Have patience, child, have patience—Rome
was not built in a day. If the gift be so valuable,
rest content, for it will come to you yet; if ease
of manner and indifference to the opinions of
others be possessions worth coveting, rest satisfied,
for in the years now before you all diffidence will
vanish and fade away, and you shall care no more
for speaking to a countess than you ever did to a
farmer’s wife in Tordale.</p>

<p class='c011'>But be not over eager, <i><span lang="fr">ma mignonne</span></i>, for the
human being has yet to be created who shall
retain a child’s heart under a woman’s manner.
Is it worth the price, Phemie? Is the external
ease and grace and self-possession a fair exchange
for the internal suffering and loss that must first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>be incurred? In this world do we get anything
cheaply? On this side of heaven can we secure any
prize without paying dearly for it? It is better
to be embarrassed at a dinner-party than to sit
nursing care o’nights. It is better that society
should have our worst than that we should be
miserable when the guests are gone and the doors
closed. The day may come when you will look
back to the blushing, timid, ignorant Phemie,
three parts through her teens, and wish you could
steal her back from the past to have and to hold
for ever—wish unavailingly, for along the road
you will then have travelled there is no return,
and the Phemie you can dimly remember—the
Phemie who was married while yet almost a child
in Tordale Church, may return to you in the
flesh, only when the rivers flow back to their
springs, when the grain ripens in December, and
the flowers and the trees bloom and look green
among winter frosts and snows.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nevertheless Phemie envied her companion,
and wished with all her heart that the calumet of
peace she and the Captain had come to smoke in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Chapel Street had not assumed the form of a
dinner-party.</p>

<p class='c011'>How could she guess that care was sitting
beside her hostess likewise?—how could she
imagine, looking at the plate, the glass, the china,
the servants, the wines, the fruits, that Mrs.
Stondon had not found it easy to arrange her
materials? that there was a terrible to-morrow,
and a more terrible morrow after, coming to the
smiling woman at the head of the table? How
could she foresee the end which came to Montague
Stondon, to his debts, to his embarrassments,
to his dinners, to his hopes, to his schemes?
When he took her under his especial protection
later on in the evening, and began “drawing her
out,” she, looking at his fine figure, at his handsome
face, never realised how stiff and stark
would be the one, how fixed and ghastly the
other, ere she set foot in England again.</p>

<p class='c011'>If she could have turned over a few pages and
read to the point where “the end” was written
across his life, she would have been tolerant and
sorrowful; as it was, she saw merely his brown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>eyes searching her through, she heard only his
soft voice asking her questions, which were full
of torture to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She liked flowers, he was certain;” so he
took her to see the conservatory, which was
always full of bloom, let who would, go without
money. “You must not compare our plants
with those you are accustomed to at Roundwood,”
he went on; “General Keller’s gardens are
famous all over Sussex, I am told.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie kept silence for a moment. She did
not know whether Captain Stondon would like
her to say she and the Kellers were far apart as
the poles; and, on the other hand, she felt it
would not be truthful for her to let Mr. Stondon
think she had ever seen her father’s birthplace.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had not lived all the most impressionable
part of her life, however, with Mr. Aggland for
nothing, and accordingly she answered timidly,
though with the tell-tale colour that offended
Mrs. Stondon flushing her face—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think your flowers beautiful, and I have
never been at Roundwood.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>“Then you have a pleasure more to come,”
replied Mr. Stondon. “I suppose it is stale news
to you that your aunt is in town. I saw her in
the Park yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie’s thoughts flew back to the cruel letter
with which her aunt had severed all ties between
them; and forgetting everything except that and
the contemptuous repulse her mother had received
from the Keller family, she retorted hotly—</p>

<p class='c011'>“That she did not know anything about Miss
Keller, and did not want to know. She had never
seen her, and she hoped she never should see
her;” after which statement, feeling she had committed
herself, the girl grew scarlet, and stooping
down over the flowers, commenced admiring
them insanely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What does your mamma say to the idea of
your staying away from her for so long a time?”
asked Mr. Stondon, smiling. She was such a
foolish little fish, and he was so skilful an angler
(this was what he thought), that there was no use
in wasting valuable bait upon her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not any mamma,” replied Phemie.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“She has been dead ever since I can remember, I
was going to say; but I can remember her, so
that would not be true. She has been dead ever
so many years—ever so many;” and the bride
bent her head again, and Montague Stondon
knew it was to hide the tears that were brimming
in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was beginning to like her. If she had been
anybody else than his relation’s wife, he would
have commenced a flirtation. She had divine
hair, she had sweet eyes, she had a delicious
voice, with the faintest, slightest Northern accent
to make it earnest and pathetic. She was soft
and pulpy, as Mrs. Montague Stondon said; but
then men are not usually averse to even an
exaggeration of feminine perfections.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was astonishingly pretty, and young, and
impulsive. The kind of girl it was possible to
fancy kissing a man out of gratitude if he had
done her a great service; a charming girl, with
the tenderest expression, with the whitest skin,
with the frankest manner, with the most extraordinary
want of self-confidence.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>“I do not blame him,” thought Montague
Stondon; “though she may have a dozen brats,
and I lose Marshlands, I do not blame him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not mean to pain you,” he said gently.
“I knew you had lost your father, but I did not
think you had lost your mother too; forgive me.”
And he looked so penitent that Phemie could not
choose but say—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have nothing to forgive, only it always
makes me sorry to talk about my mother. She
was so pretty, and she died so young.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie was pretty too; would she die young?
Mr. Stondon, looking into her face, would have
helped that selfish question presenting itself if he
could; but if Phemie was nice, Marshlands was
nicer; and though he did not blame Captain
Stondon for marrying her, it was impossible for
him to avoid speculating on what might yet be if
she were to die.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would kill him,” considered the barrister.
“How mercenary poverty makes a man! how
good people who have plenty of money ought to
be!” And then he said out loud, with a smile,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>“that he felt certain she had found some one to
take her mother’s place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have always found more fathers than
mothers,” answered Phemie; and for all he tried
hard to avoid laughing, Mr. Stondon was obliged
to do so outright, while Phemie, her little hand
resting on his arm, stood wondering what she
could have said to amuse him, wondering if
she had made any mistake—done anything
wrong.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My grandfather took care of me first,” she
explained, “and then my uncle, and—don’t you
think Captain Stondon may be wondering where
I am, and wanting me?” added Phemie, conscious
she was getting into deep water, and feebly
struggling back to land.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mean your grandfather, Mr. Keller,” suggested
Mr. Stondon, as he led her towards the
drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” answered Phemie, impatiently. “If the
Kellers had brought me up, I should have seen
Roundwood; but I had nothing to do with them;
I lived with my mother’s father, a clergyman, till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>he died, and after that with my uncle in Cumberland.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is he a clergyman, too?” demanded her host.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No—he is—he is—” and Phemie, knowing
that Mr. Stondon’s eyes were fixed upon her,
grew first hot and then cold, and then angry with
herself for fearing to say out openly in that genteel
London house how her honest uncle got his
living honestly.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a bitter pang of shame she remembered
his kindness, and contrasted it with her cowardice.
In a moment it swept through her mind that it
was like disowning him not to stand up and do
battle, if need were, for the man who had been as
a father to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is a farmer,” she finished, with a defiant
uplifting of her beautiful head. “He is a
farmer;” and the evening light fell softly on
her face as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>The same light was lying across Tordale then;
the shadows were creeping up Helbeck; they
were darkling down on the valley. Almost unconsciously
Phemie, as she saw the expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>which came over Mr. Stondon’s face, turned and
looked back at Tordale with the eyes of her
heart, and as she looked she wished she was
standing beside the waterfall, or among the
flowers in her uncle’s little garden, that she
knew were giving out their fullest sweetness in
that quiet evening hour.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall we have to stay here long?” she asked
her husband when she could escape from Mr.
Stondon, and get over to the other side of the
room. “I am so tired.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she looked so tired that Captain Stondon
observed, pityingly, “Poor child!” before he proceeded
to say that Mrs. Stondon was most anxious
to hear her sing. “You must make allowances
for her,” he added, turning to that lady; “she has
lived all her life in the country, and been unable
to receive proper instruction.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Whereupon Mrs. Montague Stondon declared
she was quite certain she should be charmed;
and, indeed, to do her justice, she had made up
her mind to go into ecstacies if Phemie only
screamed like a ballad-singer in the street.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Had not Captain Stondon promised to take
care Basil was not disappointed in his long-talked-of
trip to Norway, and did not she feel certain he
would give her husband a few hundreds to stay
the wolves for a time, at any rate?</p>

<p class='c011'>Altogether, Mrs. Montague Stondon had done
her work better than the barrister. If she could
have imagined the mess he had got into with
Phemie, she would have shaken him, weak
and languid though she professed to be. Had
she known how thoroughly the bride disliked
him, how perfectly she understood Mr. Stondon
thought her a “thing in the way,” she would
scarcely have addressed herself so amiably to her
guest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What style of music do you prefer? Did you
bring any of your songs with you? No! well,
perhaps some of mine will suit your voice.” And
Mrs. Stondon began turning over the pieces that
lay on the piano.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What, none of them?” exclaimed the barrister’s
wife in despair. “What, none of them? Can you
not recollect anything? Not one tiny ballad?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>and Mrs. Montague Stondon grew quite pathetic
about the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The difficulty is that Phemie does not accompany
herself,” said Captain Stondon at this
juncture.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps,” suggested the lady who had excited
Phemie’s envy at dinner, “perhaps I can smooth
away that difficulty, if Mrs. Stondon will only tell
me what she would like best to sing;” and she
pulled off her gloves, and spread out her skirts,
and sat down to the piano, and ran over the notes,
triumphantly glancing up at poor, fluttering, confused
Phemie the while, with a look which said—“Why
are you not as I am? There is nothing to
frighten you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What shall it be?” she asked, playing with
chords and scales and chromatic passages carelessly
as she spoke. “Some one mentioned
ballads. Was it Scotch ballads—‘Jock o’ Hazel-dean,’
for instance?” and she just swept Phemie’s
face with her dark eyes ere she bent them
on some music Captain Stondon placed before
her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“I know that,” the bride remarked in a low
voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘You’ll remember me,’” answered the lady.
“Sing it then by all means.” And thus commanded,
Phemie began.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she never ended. She broke down hopelessly,
ignominiously. She got frightened; she
got confused. The strange room, the strange
faces, the unaccustomed accompaniment, the
novelty of her position, the very sound of her
own voice alarmed her. She did her best; she
fought against her embarrassment; she struggled
on; she sang a false note; she made a desperate
effort to recover herself; then she wavered and
went wrong past redemption.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was all my fault,” remarked her accompanist,
cheerfully; “try the last verse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot, I cannot, indeed,” said Phemie, almost
crying, not daring to look round, mortified, angry,
and ashamed. “I shall never try to sing
again. I cannot sing before any one. I shall never
try.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh yes, you will,” laughed her new friend.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>“You will go abroad; you will have lessons; you
will gain courage; you will cease to be diffident;
you will learn to be confident; and finally, you
will return to England, and sing ‘Then you’ll
remember’ to me as often as I like to ask you.
Seriously, you have a splendid voice, and if it
were not breaking a commandment I should
covet it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Looking at the speaker, Phemie straightway
did break the commandment, and envied her:
envied her beauty, her figure, her ease, and
grace.</p>

<p class='c011'>What curls she had!—what a magnificent
neck!—what a lovely dress!—what a way of
putting things!</p>

<p class='c011'>She was like a picture out of one of Heath’s
“Books of Beauty.” She was like a heroine of romance—with
her long lashes—with her round arms—with
her flowing hair—with her smile half gay,
half pensive. Everything Phemie had ever dreamed
of as most lovely in her sex was there for her to
fall down before and worship, if she would; but
instead of worshipping she envied—silly child—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>woman who was not half so charming as herself.
Is not auburn hair as beautiful as raven
curls?—have not men sighed for a glance from
blue eyes as well as from black?—has not seventeen
its attractions—its young spring freshness—its
soft loveliness—though it cannot possess the
easy grace, the finished manner of five-and-twenty?
And did not five-and-twenty, with all
her social advantages, look with a kind of speculative
interest—with a vague regret at seventeen,
who thought breaking down in a song the most
terrible misfortune that could happen to her,
and who wanted to get away and cry over her
mishap.</p>

<p class='c011'>If she could only ever hope to acquire a tenth
portion of Miss Derno’s self-possession she would
be satisfied. If she could only talk as she talked—answer
questions without a change of colour—play
whatever she was requested to play—Phemie
thought she should have nothing more to ask
from heaven. And she sat and considered these
things in the corner of a distant sofa where Mrs.
Montague Stondon had placed her, while that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>lady looked her new relative over as she might
have done a piece of handsome silk in a draper’s
shop.</p>

<p class='c011'>All at once Phemie came back from her
musings, or, rather, having followed them out to
a definite point, she looked up abruptly, and said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you tell me how old Miss Derno is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now there was a question to be put suddenly
to a well-bred hostess!—and by a girl, too, whom
she had decided did not possess a second idea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why do you ask?” inquired Mrs. Montague
Stondon, with one of her sweetest smiles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I want to know,” answered Phemie,
simply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How very singular!” exclaimed her hostess;
“how very odd! How deliciously straightforward
you are! Miss Derno cannot be more than five-and-twenty,
though she looks nearly thirty. Now,
will you tell me why you wanted to know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only that I might see how many years older
she is than I,” replied Phemie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A great many, I imagine,” laughed Mrs.
Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“She is half my lifetime older,” said the girl,
earnestly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I dare say she is; but what then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, only that one may do ever so much in
half a lifetime.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know some one who might do anything she
chose,” answered Mrs. Montague Stondon, and
Phemie coloured to the very roots of her hair at
having her own thoughts put into such exceedingly
plain English.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eight years!—what might she not do in
eight years? That was what she began pondering
and considering. She could learn—she could
gain knowledge—she could work hard—she could
acquire such information as might make the man
who had married her, proud of her instead of
ashamed.</p>

<p class='c011'>For Phemie felt confident he must be ashamed
of her. It might have been all very well at Tordale,
but in London, and amongst all these grand
people (as the girl in her innocence considered
them), he must be ashamed of the wife he had
chosen.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>She felt her heart beat faster and the blood
rush up into her face as she recalled a glance that
she had seen exchanged between a pair of ladies
when she broke down in her song so hopelessly.
A raising of the eyebrows, a mere curl of the lips,
the slightest shrug of the shoulders, told Phemie
their thoughts as clearly as though they had
spoken them outright.</p>

<p class='c011'>And it was so hard—so hard because she knew
she had a better voice than Miss Derno—and
singing was her sole accomplishment, and Captain
Stondon had been proud of it! He would never
ask her to sing again; he would be afraid. He
would——</p>

<p class='c011'>“So you really are going to leave London in
two days,” said Miss Derno at this juncture,
breaking in suddenly on her reverie. “How I
envy you! How I wish I was going through
Switzerland, and to Rome, and to Naples, instead
of down to a lonely country house on the borders
of civilization, where we get letters about once a
week, and see a stranger only when a vessel is
wrecked on the coast!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>“I lived in a place as quiet as that,” answered
Phemie, “and liked it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Possibly; but you will like it no more. You
could never go back and like it again. Solitude
may be very charming, but society is more charming
still. The world may be very hollow, but it
is made up of our fellow-creatures for all that;
and we cannot live without our fellow-creatures,
bad as they are, for the simple reason that we are
gregarious animals, and that angelic company is
not obtainable on earth. Added to which,” finished
Miss Derno, “I think angels would be a little
dull.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish,” said Phemie, “you were going abroad
too. I should like it so much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So should I,” answered Miss Derno, “but
duty calls me to the ends of the earth, and I obey
the summons. When you are in Paris, Vienna,
or in any one of the hundred towns Captain
Stondon says he intends taking you to see, think
of me killing time—or, rather, being killed by
time—in a place fifteen miles from everything—from
letters—from papers—from books—from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>doctor—from a station. There is no necessary of
life near us excepting the churchyard, and we
have no society, unless a curate who wears thick
boots and spectacles, and his lame wife and about
twenty-seven children, can be called desirable
neighbours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you do all day?” asked her auditor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We sleep a great deal, and we eat every hour
or so, and we watch the vessels passing, through a
telescope; and we wonder where they are going.
Then we drive; and I ride, and walk; and some
one or other of the curate’s children is always getting
maimed; and when the doctor has happily
to be sent for, he calls at the great house, and
brings us news of the outer world—of the latest
suicide, of the most interesting murder. But
there is my aunt preparing for departure. I must
say good-bye. <i><span lang="fr">Au revoir.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am afraid it will not be <i><span lang="fr">au revoir</span></i>,” said
Phemie. “We are to be away for so long a time
that it is not likely we shall see each other again
ever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Derno laughed. “There is no ‘for ever’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>in society. Everybody meets every one sooner or
later; and, recollect, when we do meet you are to
sing ‘You’ll remember’ without a mistake. If we
were to be parted for twenty years the first thing
I should say to you would be, ‘That song, Mrs.
Stondon.’ So do not forget.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she pressed Phemie’s hand in hers, and
was gone before the girl could answer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.<br> <span class='c009'>FIVE YEARS LATER.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Five years after Mrs. Montague Stondon’s little
party in Chapel Street, the 3·55 express was tearing
along the Eastern Counties line to Disley
under the glare of the afternoon sun.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was the hottest day that summer,” so every
passenger said, and so every passenger had abundant
reason for thinking. The dust was intolerable—the
heat unendurable; if you kept the
windows down you were choked, blinded, and
generally driven distracted with dust, grit, smoke,
and small gravel; if you pulled the windows up,
you had dust still, and were roasted, baked and
boiled into the bargain.</p>

<p class='c011'>When passengers got in, at the few stations
where the train paused for such refreshment as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>could be afforded to it by water for its boiler, and
oil for its wheels, each man and each woman
seemed to bring a fire with him or her into the
carriage. If they had been furnaces, instead of
flesh and blood, they could not have added more
to the discomfort of their neighbours than was the
case.</p>

<p class='c011'>The soda-water and sherry, the lemonade, the
ginger-beer, which suffering humanity demanded
at Cambridge as an alleviation of its miseries,
might have been poured from a boiling kettle, and
then the bell rang, and the passengers took their
seats, and the train steamed out of the station,
and plunged into the open country once again,
routing up the gravel, and scattering stones and
dust as it rushed along.</p>

<p class='c011'>To heat and to dust there were, however, two
travellers who seemed indifferent. Those two
were Captain Stondon and his wife. After five
years of moving from place to place, of seeing
foreign countries, of living in hotels, in hired palaces,
in Swiss châlets and French châteaux, they
were returning by the 3·55 express to take up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>their head-quarters at Marshlands, and reside
there for good.</p>

<p class='c011'>With his back to the engine, with his hat off,
with the warm breeze tossing his hair about and
filling it full of dust, with his feet on the opposite
seat, with the ‘Times’ lying beside him, Captain
Stondon slept the sleep of the just, happily oblivious
of the heat, and unconscious that Phemie
was sitting in a direct draught.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had taken off her bonnet, and drawn the
blue silk curtain so as to shelter her eyes from the
full glare of the sun, and while the train strained
and throbbed along the rails, she looked out over
the country through which they were passing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Should you know her? Scarcely. The hair is
the same that the summer sun shone down on in
Tordale, but it is not the young hair that first entangled
Captain Stondon’s fancy. There is no
part of us that ages like the hair. Look at a
child’s hair—a boy’s—a man’s. Watch the wind
stirring each of them, and you will see what I
mean. Every year as it passes by, lays its hands
on our heads, and takes something of freshness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>and of beauty from them. What is it? you ask.
I do not know. But as we see that the leaves in
August are not the same as they were in April, so
we can perceive that the hair of a lad of nineteen
is different from what it will be at four-and-twenty.
It is young, like himself, at nineteen,
and each year that comes and goes will make it,
like himself, older.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, then, that glory of auburn hair had lost
something of its beauty, or rather, perhaps, its
beauty was different, just as Phemie’s own loveliness
was different.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had been a girl then; she was a woman
now—a woman in danger of becoming cold and
worldly through mere prosperity and absence of
trouble—a woman who disbelieved in broken
hearts, in passionate love—who looked down from
immeasurable heights of superiority on what she
called boy and girl affection, and who thought of
the dreams of her earlier life, when by chance
they recurred to her memory, as she might of a
foolish fairy tale, or of any other ridiculous fancy
of her childish days.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>A change had come over her! and Phemie acknowledged
to herself that she was changed, as
she looked out at the English scenery, which
seemed so strange and unfamiliar to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through Middlesex, and Hertford, and Essex
the train dashed on: the line passed first over the
roofs of houses—over streets—over roads, and then
the engine, settling into express-pace, sped away
northward, beside the Lea, within sight of the
prettily-wooded heights of Clapton, across the
market-gardens at Tottenham, and so on, past Edmonton,
and Waltham, and Broxbourne, and
Elsenham to Audley End, through the grounds of
which it dashed remorselessly, as though there was
no park there people wanted to look at—no house
they wished to see.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then into the flat lands of Cambridgeshire,
where each field seemed more level than the last,
where willows grew in abundance, where the line
ran beside swamps and osier beds, where there was
nothing tall except the poplar trees, nothing to
break the monotony of the scenery except church
and cathedral towers.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>After Cambridgeshire, Norfolk—great stretches
of country, bare and bleak, that the fancy could
roam out over as a man can take a walk: a country
like Ireland, where you can dig peat and burn it,
where you can walk miles without hedge or ditch
or fence, where three hours from London you can
imagine yourself at the world’s end, from whence
the express steamed rapidly on to the rich abbey-lands
surrounding Wymondham.</p>

<p class='c011'>And as she looked, she thought—thought of
the five years that had come and gone—come and
gone since she travelled from Wymondham to
London before. Shall I tell you of her life, my
reader, during those five years, before we go on to
reach the end?</p>

<p class='c011'>To be a kind mistress, a faithful steward, to
occupy herself in good works, to keep herself from
vanity and idleness were, I think, all the admonitions
Mr. Aggland gave his niece when he parted
from her among the Cumberland mountains—excellent
in their way, doubtless, but useless for
the sufficient reason that Mrs. Stondon had no
household to order, no wealth to squander, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>opportunity of assisting others, no temptation
to be over-proud either of her beauty or her
position.</p>

<p class='c011'>He might as well have told a man without a
stomach to be careful of what he ate; but then
Mr. Aggland had expected things to be different,
and so, for that matter, had Phemie herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>She thought that after the Scottish tour, after
a few months on the Continent, she and her
husband would return to Marshlands, and enter
on that home-life which is, I suppose, at some
time or other, the temporal heaven of most
women’s imaginations.</p>

<p class='c011'>She pictured to herself (in a vague, girlish way,
of course,) the great rooms filled with company, the
manner in which she would manage her establishment,
the visits she would pay to the poor, the
hours she would devote to study, and behold, as
the dream hero and the dream future had faded
out of her past life, so, when she was married,
the dream of usefulness and the dream of a
settled home faded more swiftly still, out of her
present.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>Captain Stondon did not much like England.
Moreover, he desired that before his wife entered
into English society she should combine every possible
accomplishment, every grace of manner, every
known knowledge of <i><span lang="fr">les convenances</span></i> to her other
charms.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a matter of course, Phemie was ignorant of
the world, ignorant of its usages, ignorant of what
was expected from her as the mistress of Marshlands;
and equally, perhaps, as a matter of
course, Captain Stondon desired that she should
become acquainted with the importance of her
own position; with the world, with its usages, before
he introduced her to society; and he was
confirmed in this desire by Phemie’s discomfiture
at Montague Stondon’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl was mountain bred, and had never been
out to a party in her life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every man has his own idea of wisdom, and
Captain Stondon’s idea of the correct thing under
the circumstances was to take his wife abroad, and
keep her there.</p>

<p class='c011'>In which idea he chanced to be wrong. Phemie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>would have learned more of the conventionalities
of society in a week at home than she could possibly
acquire during a twelvemonths’ residence on
the Continent.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was young enough to be moulded when he
married her; she was old enough to be a little
“eccentric” when she returned to England for
good.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those who have been bred and brought up
in society, think, and think wrongly, that it is
a difficult matter for a willing pupil to acquire its
accent.</p>

<p class='c011'>It lays such store by trifles, that it forgets what
trifles its usages really are, how soon they are
learnt. It forgets that habit is second nature, and
that if habits can be formed early, they become
second nature itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Stondon forgot this, at any rate, and
took Phemie abroad in consequence.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had found a gem among the Cumberland
hills, and he wanted to have it ground and polished
before he presented it to English society.</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not wish a speck to appear on its surface,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>a flaw to be even hinted at. The more
valuable he perceived it to be, the more anxious
he became that the world should not see it till no
defect could be perceived, till no exception could
be taken to the jewel he had discovered for himself,
and discovering, had wed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Stondon, like most men who marry
below their own station, desired that his wife
should be educated late rather than never; but
unlike the majority of his sex, his desires in this
respect were fulfilled, not disappointed.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the whole force and strength of her nature,
Phemie devoted herself to learning. She had
opportunities, and she embraced them; she had
every advantage of masters that money could
procure, and money never was better spent, than
on so industrious and clever a pupil.</p>

<p class='c011'>How she practised, how she studied, how she
observed, no one ever knew fully except by the
result.</p>

<p class='c011'>Was it easy? It was like going to school after
marriage; but nevertheless, with all her heart and
with all her soul, Phemie tried to improve herself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Was it happiness? Well, not exactly. But,
then, Phemie looked beyond the drudgery to the
reward; beyond the singing lessons to the time
when she could show off her accomplishments in
society. As the painter works for months in
solitude, as the danseuse practises her most difficult
steps for hours and days together, as the
writer toils to finish his work, as the poet polishes
and polishes his most musical lines, all for one end,
one purpose—fame; so Phemie read, and studied,
and laboured, that she might some day or other
acquire social distinction.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she tired of it. Then suddenly, like a
racer that has strained every nerve, and racked
every muscle to reach the winning post—strained
and racked beyond his strength—falls exhausted
at last, a reaction set in. She wearied of travel,
she wearied of hotels, she wearied of change of
scene, wearied with an eternal longing, with a
terrible heart-sickness for home.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was nature asserting itself. It was the old
time, the better time calling for her to come back
ere she went too far ever to return; it was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>passion, it was a fever; and through the long
nights Phemie would lie awake and cry not
the less bitterly, because silently, for home—for
home!</p>

<p class='c011'>When the southern sun was glaring down upon
the earth, she thought of the mountain breezes, of
the shady nooks among the hills, of the cool tarns,
of the trickling streams. As a man in the first
stage of fever dreams deliriously of gushing fountains,
of flowing waters, so Phemie, with that home
sickness on her, dreamt from morning till night
about Tordale, about her own little room—her
own no longer; about the heather, and the moss,
and the ferns; about the clouds floating above
Helbeck; about the mists enveloping Skillanscar.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cumberland was rarely out of her mind; but
when Cumberland faded away for a moment, it
was only that Marshlands might take its place.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had seen Marshlands, and whenever Tordale
seemed too remote a spot to travel back to,
whenever she wanted some nearer resting-place for
her fancy to alight on, she folded her wings there,
and wandered up and down under the elms and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>the fir-trees, through the gardens and the park,
till she grew weary of imagining, and longed to
start for England on the instant.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not like to say all that was in her
heart about the matter. Captain Stondon had
so evidently little intention of returning home
that Phemie held her peace till she could refrain
no longer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as is always the case with such natures,
the stream burst its bounds all at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take me home, Henry, take me home, or I
shall die,” was her entreaty; and without a word
of inquiry or remonstrance, Captain Stondon
agreed that they should retrace their steps to
England.</p>

<p class='c011'>But they got no further than Paris. There the
son Captain Stondon had been hoping for was
born—dead. There the doctor said that if Phemie
herself were to live, she must turn her face southward
again; and with the old fever not cured,
only subdued, Mrs. Stondon agreed to spend
another winter abroad.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Life was not worth having on the terms,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>told her physician; but then, as that individual
remarked, only in politer terms than I can possibly
translate—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Her life was not quite her own to throw away
for a mere whim. Her husband—” And that
was enough for Phemie. She was very grateful
to Captain Stondon; she would not have pained
him for the world; she was very fond of him;
she thought she loved him; she did more, she
was sure she loved him, and so was everybody who
saw them together. Her life was his, and for him
she turned her back on England, and within sight
of the promised land journeyed once again to the
country, that was as a house of bondage unto her.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have all felt home sickness sometime or
other; we have all hungered for the sea, or the
hills, or the sun, or the bracing mountain breezes,
with that mental hunger which is worse than any
physical suffering; we have all wanted something
in the course of our lives which we could not get;
we have stretched out our hands unavailingly;
we have sobbed through the darkness; we have
pined, we have sickened; but the passion has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>ended at last, and we have sat down finally contented
with our lot.</p>

<p class='c011'>That was what Phemie did at any rate. She
could not have continued fretting, and lived; but
she ceased fretting and grew strong, and when,
after all those years, she and her husband returned
to England, there was no tumult in her
breast about anything.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had forgotten her dreams; she had almost
forgotten her past; she had a kind and devoted
husband; she had never repented her marriage;
she had done well; she had made a very good and
a very happy thing of life, and she was travelling
down to Marshlands to take her proper place in
society, with no breath of sorrow dimming the
bright cold mirror of her existence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her sympathies had fallen to sleep with five
years’ want of exercise; her feelings had grown
dull for very lack of sorrow; her intellect was
expanded, her heart narrowed. Scenery itself
was not to her now what it had once been; she
looked on it as something which God had created
for the benefit and amusement of the rich; she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>did not understand people being tempted; she
did not comprehend people going wrong; a very
shocking thing had happened in her husband’s
family—a thing which society never mentioned
before him, and Phemie, of course, had been scandalised
by it; but at the same time she could not
comprehend how Montague Stondon could first
forge another man’s name, and then deliberately
cut his own throat.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had not liked Montague Stondon. He had
placed her at a disadvantage; but it was shocking
to think of a man committing suicide, and she
felt very sorry for his wife and only son.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the same time she was unable to understand
why Captain Stondon took the matter so much to
heart. He was not to blame. He had advanced
money over and over again, till he grew weary
of doing so, and if Mr. Montague Stondon liked
to go and forge, how was her husband to know
by intuition that he had done so?</p>

<p class='c011'>Was he to blame for declining to send 1000<em>l.</em>
to the barrister by return of post? He would
have done it had his relative told him the scrape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>he had got into, but he had not told him, and
Captain Stondon refused to make the advance,
and Montague Stondon cut his throat, and
Captain Stondon paid the money after all.</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie thought about Mr. Stondon’s brown
eyes and elaborate whiskers and expensive dinner,
as the train swept through the flat lands surrounding
Cambridge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How foolish they were to live beyond their
means!” thought this wise young woman, and
she would have said and thought the same about
any other sin or shortcoming. That her fellow-creatures
were but fallible; that flesh and blood
is prone to error; that to most the right is
difficult, the wrong easy; that the way to hell
is broad, that the path to heaven is narrow;—these
were things Phemie had yet to learn;
these were the realities she was travelling home
to meet; these were the lessons she had still to
con out of books she had never yet opened. Intellect,
study, knowledge of all abstract sciences,
of what value are they if we remain ignorant of
the living volumes around us—if we have no comprehension
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>of the struggles and temptations, of
the sins and the sorrows, of the agony and the
remorse, of the men and the women we meet day
after day?</p>

<p class='c011'>What shall we learn from Greek or from
Roman, if the lines which have been traced by
the hand of our God on the hearts of his creatures
remain to us but as the writing on the wall?
What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole
world and lose his own soul? we are asked in the
book which cannot speak foolishly—“if,” as John
Bunyan says, “the things of this world lie too
close to his heart; if the earth with its things has
bound up his roots; if he is an earth-bound soul
wrapped up in thick clay?” And, in like manner,
it is surely not too much to affirm that all
knowledge and all power, all accomplishments, all
grace, all wealth, are useless, are merely as sounding
brass and as tinkling cymbals, unless there is joined
to them a comprehension of the infirmities, temptations,
sufferings of humanity.</p>

<p class='c011'>To all, prosperity is a trial and a snare; but it
is a worse trial and a worse snare to the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>than to the old; for which reason prosperity had
not improved Mrs. Stondon. She had lived a
purely selfish existence. “Fortune had placed a
bandage over her eyes.” Driving in a carriage
through the pleasantest roads of this world, she
took no thought of those who were limping along
its roughest paths, its flintiest ways, foot-sore and
weary. Fate had been so good to her, it had
appointed her lot beside such cool streams, that
she grew hard, and the Phemie who went out of
England was not the Phemie who came back to it
five years later.</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet she was not changed quite past recognition.
The old sweetness, the old truthfulness,
the old frankness, the old steadiness of principle
underlay the superstructure of selfishness and
coldness which a too happy life had reared.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beneath the world’s burning suns, the flowers of
her spring-time had withered away; but the roots
of the plants that had borne those flowers were still
deep in her heart ready to bring forth leaves and
buds and flowers again, and finally fruit if God
saw fit; and full though her existence might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>of wealth and prosperity, still there was a vacant
chamber which had never been unlocked by mortal
hand, and which all the pomps and vanities,
all the social successes, all the praises, all the
popularity, all the flattery, and all the favour of
this world would have been impotent to fill.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes when the twilight was stealing over
the landscape—sometimes when the fleecy clouds
chased each other across the sky—when she sat
looking up at the great mountains, or from among
myrtle bowers gazed out over the sea—sometimes
when she remained very still and very quiet—when
the rush of many feet was silent, when
the sound of merriment died away, when she
was alone with herself, alone with her lonely life,
with her empty heart—I think she must have
felt that there was a want in her existence—that
she had somehow missed the mark—that God
never intended the Phemie Keller who had
danced across the hills to Strammer Tarn, who
had nursed the children at the farm, who had
cried if a person only looked crossly at her, who
had been loved and cared for, who had been in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>such trouble at leaving the old home faces behind
her, to develop into Phemie Stondon, who,
without a pulse throbbing faster at the anticipation,
was travelling home to Marshlands to
perform the duties of her station, or to neglect
them, as matters should turn out.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nevertheless, she was glad to get back to
England. The idea of a settled abode was pleasant
to her; she wanted to see her uncle, and
Helen, and Duncan; she thought, with society,
that she and Captain Stondon had stayed away
from their duties long enough; she quite believed
that court gentlemen ought to reside for some
portion of the year, at all events, on their properties;
and further, she was tired of the Continent,
tired of the heat, tired of the sun, tired of
foreign languages, of strange tongues, of residences
which were not homes.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was another reason why Phemie desired
to settle in England: she was tired of having
Captain Stondon constantly at her elbow; but
this, of course, was not the way she put it to
herself.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>He had those duties to perform I have made
mention of before, and he ought to return to
fulfil them. A man of property had scarcely a
right to spend year after year in climbing mountains,
in looking at old ruins, in making foreign
friends, in spending money abroad. Phemie
quite thought he ought to take up his abode at
Marshlands, and was very glad when he said that
he agreed with her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Montague Stondon’s death had been a shock
to him. It reminded him of purposes unaccomplished
in his own life, of negligence, unfaithfulness,
of good resolutions forgotten, of good
intentions unfulfilled. He would return and
do better for the future; and accordingly he returned,
and, unmindful of heat and dust, slept on
till the train reached Disley.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was evening then, and while the carriage
which met them at Disley rolled along the level
sandy roads, Phemie looked eagerly and longingly
for the woods surrounding Marshlands. She
strained her eyes for them as she had not strained
them to catch a first sight of famous cities far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>away, and yet when she beheld the firs and the
elms reflected against the sky, when she saw the
trees lifting their heads to heaven, when she
caught the sunset glory bathing the whole scene
in a flood of crimson light, an indefinable feeling
of sadness came over her, and her heart grew
heavy to remember that the landscape and the
woods were the same as they had been when she
looked upon them soon after her marriage, but
that she was changed—that she was going back
another Phemie from the Phemie her husband
had married, to her husband’s house.</p>
